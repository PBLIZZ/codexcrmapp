# AI-First Email Intelligence Module
## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

---

## 1. OVERVIEW

**Title:** AI-First Email Intelligence Module  
**Audience:** Wellness professionals (solopreneurs) using our Next.js CRM  
**Objective:** Provide an intelligent email assistant that autonomously manages the entire email lifecycle—from understanding natural language requests to generating context-rich, personalized email drafts, and facilitating user-approved execution.

### Core Philosophy
- This is not a traditional "email marketing" platform
- The AI leverages email as just one communication channel
- It analyzes historical and real-time CRM data to generate, send, and react to emails, while preserving full user control through an explicit approval system

---

## 2. GOALS & OBJECTIVES

- Enable users to quickly express email intents (e.g., "Reconnect with clients" or "Send a warm follow-up") in natural language
- Automatically generate unique, personalized email communications by using detailed client context (communication history, preferences, relationship depth, etc.)
- Integrate seamlessly with our CRM's Supabase backend and Next.js modular architecture
- Facilitate a fully auditable approval workflow whereby no email is sent without explicit user confirmation
- Optimize both outbound (email composition, send timing, subject line optimization) and inbound (categorization, response processing) email operations
- Allow for continuous improvement through AI learning and performance analytics

---

## 3. USER SCENARIOS & OUTCOMES

### Scenario 1: Intent-Based Email Request
- **User enters:** "Send a warm check-in to Sarah about last week's session."
- **Outcome:** The system queries CRM data for Sarah's history, dynamically generates a personalized email draft, and places it in the approval queue.

### Scenario 2: Campaign Outcome Declaration
- **User states:** "Help me reconnect with clients who haven't booked in a while."
- **Outcome:** The AI identifies the right contacts, generates individually tailored emails for each (no generic templates), and populates an approval interface for review.

### Scenario 3: Inbound Query Handling
- **Client action:** A client sends an email asking for an appointment update.
- **Outcome:** The AI reads and categorizes the incoming email, suggests a draft response (if necessary), updates CRM data, and flags any follow-up actions.

## 4. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

### A. AI Email Agent Core
- Process natural language email instructions to determine intent (e.g., re-engagement, follow-up, awareness campaign)
- Access CRM data (client history, preferences, past interactions) from Supabase to generate context-aware email drafts
- Dynamically generate unique, HTML/CSS-rich emails (subject lines, body, interactive elements) based on recipient-specific context

### B. Conversational Email Management
- A primary UI that accepts natural language commands and displays real-time confirmation prompts
- Handle conversational requests such as: "Send that campaign we discussed" or "Check my emails now"
- Enable voice-to-text capture of email commands where applicable

### C. Dynamic Personalization Engine
- Replace fixed merge tags with true individual context analysis—each email is uniquely generated
- Adapt tone and style based on recipient type and relationship depth
- Incorporate real-time data (weather, recent engagements, seasonal factors) to further refine email content

### D. Intelligent Email Processing

#### Outbound:
- Generate fully responsive email content (HTML/CSS)
- Determine optimal send timing for each recipient
- Optimize deliverability by embedding contextual interactive elements

#### Inbound:
- Integrate with an IMAP/POP engine to ingest incoming emails
- Apply AI-powered parsing to categorize responses (booking, questions, complaints, etc.)
- Automatically update CRM records and flag follow-up tasks

### E. Context-Aware Campaign Execution
- Allow users to define outcomes ("Fill Tuesday morning yoga classes", "Reconnect with 2023 clients") rather than building static campaigns
- The system dynamically identifies the target group, creates individual messages, monitors responses, and provides actionable insights

### F. AI Task Approval System
- All outgoing AI-generated emails are held in a "Draft & Approval" state
- An approval queue interface displays pending tasks with:
  - Quick preview and one-click "Approve/Reject" actions
  - Options to review, edit, or provide feedback before approval
- Maintain an audit log of approvals, rejections, and AI-learning feedback for future performance improvement

### G. Tracking & Analytics
- Beyond traditional opens and clicks, track sentiment analyses, response quality, and relationship progression over time
- Provide a dashboard with metrics such as approval rates, average response times, and measures of AI suggestion accuracy

- Maintain logs for every action (sent, approved, rejected) to drive a feedback loop that informs future AI cordiality

### E. LLM Integration Facilitation
- Expose well-defined endpoints that allow the LLM module to:
  - Input natural language user commands
  - Retrieve context (CRM data, historical communications) from Supabase
  - Submit draft email content for review
- Provide metadata about client history, current relationship stage, and business context so that the LLM can tailor its responses precisely
