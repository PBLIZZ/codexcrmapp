# Task ID: 342
# Title: Verify No New Lint Errors
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 341
# Priority: medium
# Description: Ensure that no new lint errors are introduced as a result of ESLint version updates or dependency changes.
# Details:
Run `pnpm lint` across the entire monorepo. Review the output for any new linting errors or warnings that were not present before the changes. Address these by either fixing the code, updating ESLint rules, or adjusting configurations to be compatible with ESLint v9.x. The goal is to maintain a clean linting output.

# Test Strategy:
Confirm that `pnpm lint` completes without reporting any new errors or warnings. Compare linting output before and after changes to identify any regressions.
