# Task ID: 195
# Title: Implement Name field data storage in Supabase
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 194
# Priority: high
# Description: Update the sign-up process to collect and store the user's name in Supabase auth.users.raw_user_meta_data.
# Details:
1. Modify the sign-up form submission handler to include the name field
2. Update the Supabase `auth.signUp` call to include the name in the options.data field:
   ```typescript
   const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signUp({
     email: email,
     password: password,
     options: {
       data: {
         full_name: name // Store the name collected from the form
       }
     }
   });
   ```
3. Verify that the name is correctly stored in `auth.users.raw_user_meta_data`
4. Handle any error cases appropriately
5. Ensure the form validation includes the name field as required

# Test Strategy:
1. Test sign-up with valid name, email, and password
2. Verify the name is correctly stored in Supabase `auth.users.raw_user_meta_data`
3. Test form validation for empty name field
4. Test with various name formats (short, long, with special characters)
5. Verify error handling for failed sign-ups
