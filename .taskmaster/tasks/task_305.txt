# Task ID: 305
# Title: Epic 2: Implement Task Completion
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 303
# Priority: high
# Description: Enable users to mark tasks as complete, updating the UI and database state.
# Details:
This task connects the checkbox on the `ThingsTaskCard` to a backend mutation, providing the core interactive functionality of a to-do list.

# Test Strategy:
In the UI, find a pending task and click its checkbox. Verify its appearance changes immediately (e.g., text gets a strikethrough). Refresh the page; the task should remain marked as complete. Check the `status` column in the `tasks` table for that record in Supabase to confirm it's set to 'completed'.
