# Task ID: 209
# Title: Update Supabase Auth Integration for Name Collection
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Modify the Supabase authentication integration to collect and store the user's name during sign-up.
# Details:
1. Update the sign-up function to include the name field in the metadata:

2. Verify that the name is being stored in `auth.users.raw_user_meta_data`

3. If using a separate profiles table, ensure that the database trigger is properly set up to copy the name from `raw_user_meta_data` to the profiles table

4. Test the flow to ensure the name is properly stored and accessible in the user's profile

# Test Strategy:
1. Test the sign-up process with a name provided
2. Verify in the Supabase dashboard that the name is stored in user metadata
3. Check that any database triggers correctly copy the name to the profiles table if applicable
4. Test retrieving and displaying the user's name after sign-up
5. Test with various name formats (short, long, with special characters, etc.)
