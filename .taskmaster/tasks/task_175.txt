# Task ID: 175
# Title: Add Import Progress Tracking
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 171, 172
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a mechanism to track and display the progress of CSV import operations, especially for larger files.
# Details:
Develop a progress tracking system with:

1. Backend components:
   - Progress tracking mechanism (e.g., Redis key with counter or database record)
   - Update progress at regular intervals during import (e.g., every 5% or 50 records)
   - Store both numeric progress (percentage) and status message

2. API endpoint to check progress:
   - GET endpoint returning current progress percentage and status
   - Include counts of processed, successful, and failed records
   - Include estimated time remaining if possible

3. Frontend components:
   - Progress bar showing percentage complete
   - Status message displaying current operation
   - Counts of processed/total records
   - Polling mechanism to update progress (with exponential backoff)

4. Handle edge cases:
   - Import completion
   - Import failure/errors
   - Timeout or connection loss

Ensure the system is resilient to network issues and provides a good user experience even for larger imports. Consider using WebSockets for real-time updates if the infrastructure supports it.

# Test Strategy:
Test progress tracking with various file sizes. Verify accurate progress reporting. Test the polling mechanism and ensure it handles network interruptions gracefully. Verify the UI updates correctly as progress changes. Test with simulated slow imports to ensure the experience remains good for larger files.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Backend Progress Tracking Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement a system to track import progress on the backend
### Details:
Create a mechanism to track import progress percentages, including: 1) Data structure to store progress state (Redis or database), 2) Methods to update progress during import process, 3) Tracking of items processed vs. total items, 4) Timestamp tracking for estimated completion time calculations, 5) Status tracking (pending, in-progress, completed, failed)

## 2. Create Progress Reporting API Endpoint [pending]
### Dependencies: 175.1
### Description: Develop an API endpoint that returns the current status of an import job
### Details:
Implement a RESTful endpoint that: 1) Accepts an import job ID, 2) Returns current progress percentage, status, estimated time remaining, and any errors, 3) Includes appropriate error handling for invalid or completed jobs, 4) Implements rate limiting to prevent excessive polling, 5) Documents the API for frontend developers

## 3. Implement Frontend Polling and Progress Display [pending]
### Dependencies: 175.2
### Description: Create frontend components to poll the progress API and display status to users
### Details:
Develop frontend functionality including: 1) Polling mechanism with appropriate intervals (starting frequent, slowing down over time), 2) Progress bar component with percentage display, 3) Estimated time remaining indicator, 4) Status messages for different stages of import, 5) Graceful handling of polling interruptions, 6) Auto-stopping polling when import completes or fails

## 4. Implement Error and Edge Case Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 175.1, 175.2, 175.3
### Description: Add comprehensive error handling and edge case management for the import progress system
### Details:
Address various error scenarios and edge cases: 1) Connection loss handling with automatic retry logic, 2) Timeout handling for long-running imports, 3) Error reporting in the UI with appropriate messages, 4) Handling of canceled imports, 5) Recovery mechanisms for failed imports, 6) Logging of errors for debugging, 7) Testing with simulated network issues and server errors
