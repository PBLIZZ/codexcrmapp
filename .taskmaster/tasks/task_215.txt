# Task ID: 215
# Title: Implement Contact Relationship Hub with Timeline Visualization
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 212, 213, 226, 227
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the Contact Relationship Hub module with enhanced contact list, detailed contact cards, wellness journey timelines, and AI-powered relationship insights.
# Details:
Create a comprehensive contact management system with the following features:

1. Enhanced contact list with:
   - Customizable columns
   - Bulk actions
   - Advanced filtering and sorting
   - Quick action buttons
2. Detailed contact cards with:
   - Wellness journey timeline visualization
   - Session history with note-taking capabilities
   - Client-submitted media integration placeholder
   - Referral tracking visualization
3. AI-powered relationship insights panel
4. Group management interface
5. Quick email/message composers

Implementation details:
- Use TanStack Table v8+ for the contact list with advanced features
- Implement virtualized lists for performance with large contact databases
- Create a timeline visualization component using a custom React component
- Use tRPC procedures for data fetching with proper pagination
- Implement optimistic UI updates for better user experience
- Use React Hook Form for quick message composers

Example contact list implementation:
```tsx
// components/contacts/ContactList.tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import {
  useReactTable,
  getCoreRowModel,
  getPaginationRowModel,
  getSortedRowModel,
  getFilteredRowModel,
  ColumnDef,
  flexRender,
} from '@tanstack/react-table';
import { trpc } from '@/lib/trpc';

export function ContactList() {
  const [sorting, setSorting] = useState([]);
  const [columnFilters, setColumnFilters] = useState([]);
  const [pagination, setPagination] = useState({ pageIndex: 0, pageSize: 20 });
  
  const { data, isLoading } = trpc.contacts.list.useQuery({
    page: pagination.pageIndex,
    limit: pagination.pageSize,
    filters: columnFilters,
    sorting,
  });
  
  const columns = [
    // Define columns here
  ];
  
  const table = useReactTable({
    data: data?.contacts || [],
    columns,
    state: {
      sorting,
      columnFilters,
      pagination,
    },
    onSortingChange: setSorting,
    onColumnFiltersChange: setColumnFilters,
    onPaginationChange: setPagination,
    getCoreRowModel: getCoreRowModel(),
    getPaginationRowModel: getPaginationRowModel(),
    getSortedRowModel: getSortedRowModel(),
    getFilteredRowModel: getFilteredRowModel(),
    manualPagination: true,
    pageCount: data?.pageCount || 0,
  });
  
  // Render table UI
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for contact list filtering, sorting, and pagination
2. Integration tests for contact data fetching and manipulation
3. Component tests for timeline visualization with sample data
4. End-to-end tests for contact creation, editing, and deletion workflows
5. Performance testing with large datasets (1000+ contacts)
6. Accessibility testing for all contact management interfaces
7. Visual regression tests for timeline visualization
8. User acceptance testing with wellness professionals to validate the relationship-focused approach
