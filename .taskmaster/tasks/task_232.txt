# Task ID: 232
# Title: MCP Client Architecture Foundation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 223, 219
# Priority: medium
# Description: Establish Model Context Protocol client architecture for third-party integrations
# Details:
Build MCP client foundation with: 1) Abstract MCP client interface for standardized integration 2) Authentication flow management for OAuth providers 3) Configuration management for API keys and settings 4) Error handling and retry mechanisms 5) Rate limiting and quota management 6) Integration status monitoring 7) Webhook handling for real-time updates. Create base classes that can be extended for specific integrations.

# Test Strategy:
Authentication flow testing, error handling validation, rate limiting verification, webhook processing testing, and integration status monitoring

# Subtasks:
## 1. Abstract Interface Design [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement abstract interfaces and base classes for third-party integrations to ensure consistent API contracts and enable polymorphic behavior across different service providers.
### Details:
Create abstract base classes, define common interface methods, establish data transfer objects, implement factory patterns for integration instantiation, and design extensible plugin architecture for future integrations.

## 2. Authentication Management System [pending]
### Dependencies: 232.1
### Description: Develop a comprehensive authentication management system to handle various authentication methods (OAuth, API keys, tokens) across different third-party services securely.
### Details:
Implement OAuth 2.0 flows, secure credential storage and rotation, token refresh mechanisms, multi-tenant authentication support, and authentication middleware for request interception.

## 3. Configuration System Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 232.1
### Description: Build a flexible configuration system that allows dynamic configuration of third-party integrations without code changes, supporting environment-specific settings and runtime modifications.
### Details:
Create configuration schema validation, environment-based config loading, hot-reload capabilities, configuration versioning, and admin interface for configuration management.

## 4. Error Handling Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 232.1, 232.2
### Description: Implement a robust error handling framework that provides consistent error responses, retry mechanisms, circuit breakers, and graceful degradation for third-party integration failures.
### Details:
Design error classification system, implement exponential backoff retry logic, create circuit breaker patterns, establish fallback mechanisms, and build error reporting and alerting systems.

## 5. Monitoring and Observability Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 232.1, 232.2, 232.3, 232.4
### Description: Develop comprehensive monitoring and observability features including metrics collection, logging, tracing, and health checks for all third-party integrations to ensure system reliability and performance.
### Details:
Implement distributed tracing, create custom metrics and dashboards, establish structured logging, build health check endpoints, set up alerting rules, and create performance monitoring for API calls and response times.
