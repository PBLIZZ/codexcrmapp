# Task ID: 364
# Title: Audit Client Components for Old Patterns
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 359
# Priority: medium
# Description: Identify all Client Components that use old fetch patterns or direct API calls
# Details:
1. Search in `apps/web` for all `.tsx` files that have `'use client'` directive
2. Look for files that:
   - Use `fetch('/api/contacts')` or similar direct API calls
   - Use `useEffect` with data fetching
   - Have form submission handlers that call `fetch()`
3. Create a list of all such files with their current patterns
4. Do not modify any code, only document findings

# Test Strategy:
1. Provide a complete list of affected Client Components
2. Show the specific patterns that need to be changed
3. Confirm no Client Components were missed
