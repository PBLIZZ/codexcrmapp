# Task ID: 35
# Title: Epic B: Core AI Automation Engine
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 48, 54, 56
# Priority: high
# Description: Developing the AI-powered automation features for contact enrichment, email processing, calendar management, and smart contact segmentation. Incorporates original task 9 and new AI features.
# Details:
This epic enhances the LLM integration to provide intelligent automation features including email processing, calendar management, and contact segmentation. This epic depends on Epic 2 (ID 48) for core functionality.

# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
