# Task ID: 265
# Title: Simplify MainLayout.tsx to a Skeleton
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 257, 258, 260
# Priority: high
# Description: Strip MainLayout.tsx down to its essential structural role, integrating all the new components to create a clean, modular layout structure.
# Details:
1. Refactor the MainLayout.tsx file to remove all complex logic and state management
2. Import and render the new Header, AppSidebarController, and OmniBotFloat components
3. Define the primary page grid structure
4. Ensure the layout is responsive and accessible

# Test Strategy:
1. Render the MainLayout component with mock children
2. Verify that Header, AppSidebarController, and OmniBotFloat components are properly imported and rendered
3. Test the layout structure with different viewport sizes
4. Ensure the main content area correctly adjusts based on sidebar presence
5. Verify that the layout is accessible and follows best practices
6. Test that the component is significantly simpler than the original version
7. Perform integration tests with actual page content to ensure the layout works correctly in a real application context
