# Task ID: 254
# Title: Remove user prop from MainLayout and update related components
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 252, 253
# Priority: medium
# Description: Remove the user prop from MainLayout component and update any child components that were receiving user data through prop drilling
# Details:
1. Remove user prop from MainLayout component interface
2. Update MainLayout to use useAuth hook instead of props
3. Find and update any child components that were receiving user via props
4. Replace prop drilling with useAuth hook usage in components that need user data
5. Ensure all components that need auth state use the useAuth hook directly
6. Test that user data is accessible throughout the component tree

# Test Strategy:
Verify MainLayout no longer receives user prop, all components can access user data via useAuth hook, no prop drilling remains, and user data is consistent across components
