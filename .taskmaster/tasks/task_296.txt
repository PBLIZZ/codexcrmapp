# Task ID: 296
# Title: Update tRPC API Endpoints to tRPC v11 Standards
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Refactor tRPC endpoints to use tRPC v11 patterns with authentication and application data security focus.
# Details:
Scan `src/trpc/**` files for legacy patterns with special attention to application API endpoints: authentication endpoints (login, signup, forgot password), protected data operations for the 8 main sections (Dashboard, Contacts, Tasks, Messages, Calendar, Marketing, Analytics, Settings), user session management, and notification/toast data endpoints. Apply an automated script to update to tRPC v11 with enhanced type safety for application data models, improved error handling for authentication operations, optimized query performance for section data loading, and enhanced security for user session management. Implement proper input validation and sanitization for all user data. Run `tsc` to validate and ensure integration tests pass. Output a JSON diff report showing API endpoint improvements.

# Test Strategy:
Compile with `tsc` and run integration tests with focus on authentication and section data operations. Ensure the diff report shows updates and application-specific security enhancements.
