# Task ID: 334
# Title: Centralize Common Dev Dependencies
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 333
# Priority: high
# Description: Move common development dependencies like `typescript`, `@types/react`, `@types/react-dom`, `@types/node`, and `rimraf` to the root `package.json` to reduce duplication and improve build performance.
# Details:
Identify all instances of `typescript`, `@types/react`, `@types/react-dom`, `@types/node`, and `rimraf` in individual workspace `package.json` files. Remove them from these packages and add them as `devDependencies` to the root `package.json`. Ensure that the versions are consistent with the target state (e.g., `typescript: ^5.6.0`). After moving, run `pnpm install` at the root to ensure dependencies are hoisted correctly.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that all packages can still access and use these centralized dependencies. Check the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file to confirm that these dependencies are installed only once at the root level. Monitor build performance and memory usage for improvements.
