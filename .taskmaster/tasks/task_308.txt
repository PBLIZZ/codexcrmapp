# Task ID: 308
# Title: Epic 3: Implement Task-to-Project Assignment
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 306, 307
# Priority: medium
# Description: Allow existing tasks to be assigned to a project.
# Details:
This task provides the functionality to organize existing tasks into projects, a key organizational feature.

# Test Strategy:
Create a task without a project (it should appear in the 'Inbox'). Open the task's detail view, use the project dropdown to assign it to 'Project A', and save. Return to the main view; the task should no longer be in the 'Inbox' but should now appear when you filter by 'Project A'.
