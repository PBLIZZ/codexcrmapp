# Task ID: 308
# Title: Epic 3: Implement Task-to-Project Assignment
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 306, 307
# Priority: medium
# Description: Allow existing tasks to be assigned to a project.
# Details:
This task provides the functionality to organize existing tasks into projects, a key organizational feature.

# Test Strategy:
Create a task without a project (it should appear in the 'Inbox'). Open the task's detail view, use the project dropdown to assign it to 'Project A', and save. Return to the main view; the task should no longer be in the 'Inbox' but should now appear when you filter by 'Project A'.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement `task.updateProject` tRPC Mutation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a mutation to update a task's `project_id`.
### Details:
In `taskRouter`, create a new `updateProject` mutation that takes `{ taskId: string, projectId: string | null }` and updates the `project_id` field of the specified task.

## 2. Add Project Dropdown to Task Detail UI [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: In the UI for viewing/editing a task, add a dropdown to change its project.
### Details:
In the task detail view, add a dropdown populated with the user's projects (from `project.list`). Its value should be the task's current `projectId`. When changed, it should call the `task.updateProject` mutation.
