# Task ID: 297
# Title: Optimize Bundle and Improve Performance Metrics
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 289, 294, 295
# Priority: medium
# Description: Analyze bundle, apply optimizations, and measure performance improvements with core user experience focus.
# Details:
Use webpack-bundle-analyzer to analyze the bundle with special attention to core application component bundles: authentication components, sidebar navigation (AppSidebarController, section sidebars), main layout components, dashboard widgets, and the 8 main section entry points. Apply code splitting for main section routes, dynamic imports for heavy components (Analytics, Marketing), and lazy loading for non-critical features. Optimize authentication flow performance, implement efficient caching for section data, and reduce bundle size for faster page transitions. Enhance Sonner toast loading performance and Omnibot responsiveness. Re-run `npx next build --profile` and capture metrics. Output a JSON report with improvements focusing on user experience metrics: authentication flow speed, sidebar responsiveness, and section transition times.

# Test Strategy:
Compare new metrics to baseline (Task 289) with focus on core user scenarios. Confirm at least 10% bundle size reduction, improved TTI for protected pages, and enhanced performance for authentication flow and section navigation.
