# Task ID: 286
# Title: Identify Naming Convention Violations in Code Files
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 285
# Priority: medium
# Description: Check file names against regex pattern for naming conventions and generate a Markdown report of violations with business-critical component prioritization.
# Details:
For each file in `src/components/**` and `app/**/page.tsx` from the JSON file list (Task 285 output), use regex `^[A-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]+\.tsx$` to validate file names. Generate a Markdown report with sections for: file path, expected pattern, violation status, and application section (Dashboard, Contacts, Tasks, Messages, Calendar, Marketing, Analytics, Settings). Prioritize violations in core navigation components (AppSidebarController, MainLayout, UserNav) and authentication flow components first.

# Test Strategy:
Validate that each file name is checked against the regex. The Markdown report must list all deviations with business impact assessment. Re-run the check on a sample to confirm accuracy.
