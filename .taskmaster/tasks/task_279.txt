# Task ID: 279
# Title: Create the Dashboard Page Entry Point
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 278
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the main server component for the dashboard route (/), which will serve as the application's homepage, replacing the old redirect logic.
# Details:
1. Create or update `apps/web/app/page.tsx`
2. Import the necessary components including PageHeader and the new DashboardWidgets component
3. Structure the component as follows:
```tsx
import { PageHeader } from '@/components/layout/PageHeader';
import { DashboardWidgets } from '@/app/dashboard/components/DashboardWidgets';

export default function DashboardPage() {
  return (
    <>
      <PageHeader breadcrumbs={[{ label: 'Dashboard' }]} />
      <main className="p-4 md:p-6">
        <DashboardWidgets />
      </main>
    </>
  );
}
```
4. Ensure the page is properly configured as a Next.js server component
5. Remove any old redirect logic that was previously used for the homepage

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that the dashboard page renders correctly at the root URL (/)
2. Check that the PageHeader displays the correct breadcrumb
3. Ensure the DashboardWidgets component is properly imported and rendered
4. Test navigation to and from the dashboard page to confirm routing is working correctly
