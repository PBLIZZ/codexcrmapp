# Task ID: 345
# Title: Measure Performance Improvements (Build, Install, Bundle)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 344
# Priority: low
# Description: Measure and confirm improvements in build time, install time, and bundle size.
# Details:
Before starting the project, record baseline metrics for build time (e.g., `pnpm build` duration), install time (e.g., `pnpm install` duration on a clean cache), and application bundle size (e.g., using `webpack-bundle-analyzer` or similar tools for the main application). After all tasks are complete, re-measure these metrics and compare them to the baselines. Aim for a 20% improvement in build time, 25% in install time, and 15% in bundle size.

# Test Strategy:
Record and compare build times, install times, and main application bundle sizes before and after the project. Verify that the target percentage improvements are met or exceeded.
