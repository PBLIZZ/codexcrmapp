# Details:


# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Database Queries and Indexes [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create efficient database queries and indexes to support global search across all entity types
### Details:
Analyze existing database schema and create appropriate indexes for search fields across contacts, groups, reminders, and interactions tables. Implement full-text search capabilities if supported by the database. Design query patterns that can efficiently search across multiple tables with proper performance considerations. Document the indexing strategy and expected query performance.

## 2. Create tRPC Search Procedures [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Implement tRPC procedures that handle search queries across different entity types
### Details:
Develop tRPC procedures that accept search terms and return results from multiple entity types. Implement pagination for large result sets. Add type safety for search results. Include relevance scoring to prioritize more relevant results. Handle error cases gracefully. Add proper input validation and sanitization.

## 3. Implement Search Input UI with Suggestions [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.2
### Description: Create the search input component with auto-suggestions functionality
### Details:
Build a search input component with debounced input handling. Implement auto-suggestions that appear as the user types. Add keyboard navigation for suggestions. Style the input and suggestions dropdown according to the application design system. Ensure accessibility compliance for the search input.

## 4. Build Search Results Display [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.2, 14.3
### Description: Create the UI for displaying search results with categories and result highlighting
### Details:
Develop a component to display search results grouped by entity type (contacts, groups, etc.). Implement text highlighting to show where matches occurred. Create appropriate visual representations for each entity type in results. Add empty state handling when no results are found. Ensure the results display is responsive across device sizes.

## 5. Add Search Filters [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.4
### Description: Implement filters to allow users to refine search results
### Details:
Create UI controls for filtering search results by entity type, date ranges, and other relevant attributes. Update the tRPC procedures to handle filter parameters. Implement client-side state management for active filters. Ensure filters can be combined and cleared easily. Add visual indicators for active filters.

## 6. Implement Recent Searches Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.3, 14.4
### Description: Add the ability to track and display recent user searches
### Details:
Create a mechanism to store recent searches (local storage or database). Build UI to display recent searches when the search input is focused. Add the ability to clear individual or all recent searches. Implement functionality to quickly re-execute a recent search. Ensure recent searches are user-specific if the application supports multiple users.
