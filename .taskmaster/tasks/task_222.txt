# Task ID: 222
# Title: Database Schema Refactoring - Core Tables
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 212
# Priority: high
# Description: Refactor Supabase database schema to support AI-powered features and enhanced contact management
# Details:
Create enhanced database schema with the following tables: 1) Restructure contacts table with core fields (id, name, email, phone, created_at, updated_at) 2) Create contact_profiles table for extended information (wellness_goals, preferences, notes, ai_insights) 3) Create sessions table (id, contact_id, date, type, notes, ai_analysis) 4) Create ai_actions table (id, type, suggestion, status, approved_by, created_at) 5) Create notes table with AI tagging support 6) Add proper foreign key relationships and indexes for performance. Use Supabase CLI migrations and ensure RLS policies are properly configured.

# Test Strategy:
Create comprehensive migration tests, verify foreign key constraints, test RLS policies, and validate data integrity with sample data insertion

# Subtasks:
## 1. Core Table Creation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and create the fundamental database tables with proper column definitions, data types, constraints, and primary keys
### Details:
Define table schemas including column specifications, data types, null constraints, default values, primary keys, and basic table-level constraints. Create tables in logical order considering dependencies.

## 2. Relationship Establishment [done]
### Dependencies: 222.1
### Description: Implement foreign key relationships, junction tables, and referential integrity constraints between core tables
### Details:
Create foreign key constraints, establish one-to-many and many-to-many relationships, implement cascade rules, and ensure referential integrity across all table relationships.

## 3. RLS Policy Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: 222.1, 222.2
### Description: Design and implement Row Level Security policies for data access control and user authorization
### Details:
Enable RLS on tables, create security policies for different user roles, implement tenant isolation, and establish fine-grained access controls based on user context and permissions.

## 5. Performance Optimization with Indexing [done]
### Dependencies: 222.1, 222.2
### Description: Analyze query patterns and implement strategic indexing for optimal database performance
### Details:
Create indexes on frequently queried columns, implement composite indexes for complex queries, optimize foreign key performance, and establish query execution monitoring and tuning strategies.
