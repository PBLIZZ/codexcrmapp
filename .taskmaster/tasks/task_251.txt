# Task ID: 251
# Title: Refactor RootLayout to pure Server Component
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 246, 247, 250
# Priority: high
# Description: Refactor apps/web/app/layout.tsx to be a pure Server Component by removing all client-side hooks and authentication logic
# Details:
1. Remove 'use client' directive from layout.tsx
2. Remove all useState and useEffect hooks for auth management
3. Remove user state management and prop drilling
4. Keep only static HTML shell (html, body tags) and global providers
5. Import and render new AppContent component
6. Ensure Server Component compatibility with Next.js 15

# Test Strategy:
Verify layout is a Server Component, no client-side hooks remain, application renders correctly, and Next.js build succeeds without warnings
