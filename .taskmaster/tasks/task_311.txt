# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 301

This is a critical, user-facing security and integration feature that must be smooth and reliable.

# Test Strategy:

On redirect, ensure you are presented with a dropdown of your calendars. Select one. Verify the UI updates to a 'Connected' state and that this state persists on refresh.
