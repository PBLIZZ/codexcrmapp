# Task ID: 260
# Title: Create AppSidebarController Component
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 259
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a new AppSidebarController.tsx component to manage the display of contextual sidebars based on the current route.
# Details:
1. Create a new file at apps/web/components/layout/AppSidebarController.tsx
2. Use the usePathname hook to determine the current route
3. Implement logic to decide which sidebar to render based on the route
4. Import all potential sidebar components

# Test Strategy:
1. Test the component with various mocked pathname values
2. Verify that the correct sidebar component is rendered for each route
3. Test edge cases like unknown routes
4. Ensure the component correctly handles nested routes
5. Verify that the component updates when the pathname changes
6. Test with a real router context to ensure integration with Next.js routing
