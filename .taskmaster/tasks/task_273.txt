# Task ID: 273
# Title: Create Data Transformation Layer for snake_case to camelCase
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 267, 272
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement utilities to transform data between database snake_case and JavaScript camelCase conventions
# Details:
Create utility functions for case conversion: toCamelCase(), toSnakeCase(), transformKeys(). Implement database query wrappers that automatically transform results. Use libraries like lodash.camelcase or create custom transformation functions. Setup Supabase client configuration to handle automatic case conversion. Create type-safe transformation functions that maintain TypeScript inference. Handle nested objects and arrays in transformations. Consider using libraries like humps or change-case for robust conversion.

# Test Strategy:
Test transformation functions with various data structures. Verify type safety is maintained through transformations. Test with real database queries and API responses. Create unit tests for edge cases like nested objects and arrays.
