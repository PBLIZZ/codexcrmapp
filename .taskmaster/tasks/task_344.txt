# Task ID: 344
# Title: Measure Dependency Count Reduction
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 343
# Priority: medium
# Description: Measure and confirm the reduction in total dependency count, aiming for a 30% reduction.
# Details:
Before starting the cleanup, record the total number of installed packages (e.g., by analyzing `pnpm-lock.yaml` or using `pnpm list --json`). After all cleanup and centralization tasks are complete, re-measure the total dependency count. Compare the two numbers to verify the target reduction. This metric directly reflects the success of dependency cleanup and centralization.

# Test Strategy:
Compare the total number of unique packages in `pnpm-lock.yaml` before and after the changes. Calculate the percentage reduction to ensure it meets or exceeds 30%.
