# Task ID: 292
# Title: Map Inter-module Dependencies Within the Monorepo
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Generate a dependency graph and JSON map of module dependencies with application workflow visualization.
# Details:
Run `npx madge --json .` to generate a JSON dependency map. Convert the JSON to Graphviz DOT format for visualization with special highlighting of core application workflow dependencies: authentication flow (login → dashboard → protected pages), sidebar navigation dependencies (AppSidebarController → section sidebars), main layout component relationships, and cross-section data flow. Include application-specific dependency categorization and critical path identification for user journey continuity. Output both JSON and DOT files with workflow annotations.

# Test Strategy:
Confirm the JSON map lists correct dependencies with application workflow context. Run `npx madge --json .` and compare output. Check that the DOT file is valid and includes application workflow visualization.
