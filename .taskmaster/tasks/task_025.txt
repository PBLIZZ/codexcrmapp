# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Comprehensive Test Scenarios [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop detailed test scenarios covering all user flows, edge cases, and integration points in the application
### Details:
Document test cases for each feature, including expected outcomes, test data requirements, and preconditions. Ensure coverage of happy paths, error scenarios, and boundary conditions. Organize test scenarios by functional area and priority.

## 2. Set Up UAT Environment and User Access [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Prepare the UAT environment with production-like data and configure access for all test participants
### Details:
Deploy the latest build to the UAT environment, populate with sanitized production data, configure user accounts with appropriate permissions, and provide access instructions to all testers. Verify environment stability before testing begins.

## 3. Conduct End-to-End Testing of Critical Paths [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.1, 25.2
### Description: Execute comprehensive E2E tests on all critical user journeys and core functionality
### Details:
Follow test scenarios to validate complete user journeys from start to finish. Document all findings, including screenshots and steps to reproduce issues. Focus on business-critical paths first, then secondary functionality.

## 4. Implement Issue Tracking and Resolution Process [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.3
### Description: Establish a structured process for logging, prioritizing, and resolving issues discovered during testing
### Details:
Configure issue tracking system, define severity levels, establish triage process, and create dashboards for monitoring progress. Set up regular defect review meetings and define resolution workflows for different issue types.

## 5. Perform Load and Performance Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.2
### Description: Evaluate system performance under expected and peak load conditions
### Details:
Define performance benchmarks, create test scripts for simulating user load, execute tests with increasing concurrent users, and monitor system metrics. Identify bottlenecks and performance issues, then recommend optimizations.

## 6. Conduct Final Accessibility and Security Reviews [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.3, 25.5
### Description: Perform comprehensive accessibility compliance checks and security vulnerability assessments
### Details:
Run automated accessibility scans, conduct manual testing with assistive technologies, perform security penetration testing, and validate compliance with relevant standards (WCAG, OWASP). Document findings and remediation steps for any issues discovered.
