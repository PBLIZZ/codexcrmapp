# Task ID: 300
# Title: Update Documentation and Perform Repository Cleanup
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 298, 299
# Priority: medium
# Description: Revise documentation and remove temporary files with focus on application implementation guidance.
# Details:
Update README.md with CodexApp-specific setup instructions, best practices docs with application development guidelines, and architecture diagrams showing authentication flow, sidebar navigation structure, and the 8 main section relationships. Include API documentation for the main sections, user workflow guides, and core component documentation (AppSidebarController, MainLayout, Omnibot). Update TypeScript best practices with application data model guidelines and Sonner toast implementation patterns. Run a cleanup script to delete temporary files (e.g., old logs, reports, deprecated components). Output a JSON cleanup log with documentation improvements and application implementation guidance.

# Test Strategy:
Check that documentation reflects current application architecture and implementation. Verify no temporary files remain and that application-specific documentation is comprehensive and accurate. Validate that new developers can understand authentication flow and section architecture from documentation.
