# Task ID: 333
# Title: Unify Supabase to v2.49.4
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 332
# Priority: medium
# Description: Standardize all Supabase packages to the latest stable version 2.49.4 to ensure consistent authentication flows and stable database connections.
# Details:
Update `@supabase/supabase-js` and any other Supabase-related packages in all `package.json` files to `^2.49.4`. Review Supabase migration guides for any breaking changes between the current and target versions. Example `package.json` entry: `"@supabase/supabase-js": "^2.49.4"`. Run `pnpm install` and test authentication and database interactions.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that user authentication flows (sign-up, sign-in, sign-out) work correctly. Confirm that database queries and mutations function as expected. Check for any runtime errors related to Supabase.
