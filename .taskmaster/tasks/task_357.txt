# Task ID: 357
# Title: Comprehensive Monorepo Validation and Testing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 346, 347, 348, 349, 350, 351, 352, 353, 354, 355, 356
# Priority: high
# Description: Perform comprehensive validation and testing across the entire monorepo after all centralization and cleanup tasks.
# Details:
Execute a full monorepo build (`pnpm build`). Run all unit, integration, and end-to-end tests across all packages. Verify that all UI components render correctly and interact as expected. Confirm that authentication flows and API endpoints function without regressions. Start the development server and ensure all applications within the monorepo are fully functional. Conduct performance measurements (e.g., build times, bundle sizes) to ensure improvements or at least no degradation. This task serves as the final verification step before considering the project complete.

# Test Strategy:
Execute `pnpm build` at the monorepo root. Run `pnpm test` (or equivalent) for all packages. Manually test critical user flows in the UI. Use tools like Lighthouse or WebPageTest to measure performance metrics (build time, bundle size, page load time). Verify that all acceptance criteria outlined in the PRD (e.g., build tool count, package complexity, version consistency) are met. Document any regressions or unexpected behavior for immediate resolution.
