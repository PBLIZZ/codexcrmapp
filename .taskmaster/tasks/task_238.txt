# Task ID: 238
# Title: Performance Optimization and Caching
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 223, 224
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive performance optimization and caching strategies
# Details:
Optimize application performance with: 1) React Query for server state management and caching 2) Next.js Image optimization for contact photos and media 3) Database query optimization with proper indexing 4) Component lazy loading and code splitting 5) Virtual scrolling for large lists 6) Service worker for offline capabilities 7) CDN configuration for static assets. Implement performance monitoring with Web Vitals and error tracking.

# Test Strategy:
Performance benchmarking, cache hit rate monitoring, lazy loading verification, offline functionality testing, and Web Vitals measurement

# Subtasks:
## 1. Caching Strategy Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement comprehensive caching mechanisms including in-memory caching, Redis/Memcached setup, cache invalidation strategies, and cache hierarchy for different data types and access patterns.
### Details:
Set up multi-level caching with browser cache, application cache, and distributed cache. Implement cache-aside, write-through, and write-behind patterns. Configure cache expiration policies and cache warming strategies.

## 2. Database Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Optimize database performance through query optimization, indexing strategies, connection pooling, and database schema improvements to reduce query execution time and resource usage.
### Details:
Analyze slow queries, create appropriate indexes, implement database connection pooling, optimize table structures, and set up read replicas. Configure query caching and database-level optimizations.

## 3. Lazy Loading Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement lazy loading mechanisms for images, components, and data to reduce initial page load time and improve perceived performance by loading content on-demand.
### Details:
Set up image lazy loading with intersection observer, implement code splitting for components, configure dynamic imports, and establish lazy data fetching patterns with pagination and infinite scroll.

## 4. Service Worker Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: 238.1
### Description: Configure service workers for offline functionality, background sync, push notifications, and advanced caching strategies to enhance user experience and application reliability.
### Details:
Implement service worker registration, cache management strategies, offline fallbacks, background synchronization, and push notification handling. Integrate with existing caching strategy.

## 5. CDN Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 238.1, 238.3
### Description: Configure Content Delivery Network to distribute static assets globally, reduce latency, and improve load times by serving content from geographically distributed edge servers.
### Details:
Set up CDN for static assets, configure cache headers, implement asset optimization and compression, establish CDN purging strategies, and integrate with lazy loading mechanisms.

## 6. Performance Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 238.1, 238.2, 238.3, 238.4, 238.5
### Description: Implement comprehensive performance monitoring and analytics to track application performance metrics, identify bottlenecks, and measure the effectiveness of optimization strategies.
### Details:
Set up performance monitoring tools, configure real user monitoring (RUM), implement synthetic monitoring, create performance dashboards, and establish alerting for performance degradation across all optimization layers.
