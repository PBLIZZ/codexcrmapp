# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Design CSV/JSON import functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the user interface and backend logic for importing data from CSV and JSON files
### Details:
Design a file upload component that accepts CSV and JSON files. Implement validation to ensure file format correctness. Create parsers for both CSV and JSON formats that can handle various data structures. Design error handling for malformed files and data type mismatches. Consider implementing a preview feature to allow users to verify data before final import.

## 2. Implement data export functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 72.1
### Description: Create mechanisms to export application data to CSV and JSON formats
### Details:
Develop backend services to query and format data for export. Implement data transformation logic to convert application data models to CSV/JSON structures. Create download handlers that generate properly formatted files. Add options for users to select specific data subsets for export. Ensure exported files maintain data integrity and include all necessary fields.

## 3. Create user documentation and error handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 72.1, 72.2
### Description: Develop comprehensive documentation and robust error handling for the import/export features
### Details:
Write clear user instructions for both import and export processes. Document supported file formats and data structures. Implement detailed error messages for common import issues (format errors, missing fields, etc.). Create a logging system to track import/export operations for troubleshooting. Test with various edge cases including large files, special characters, and different encodings.
