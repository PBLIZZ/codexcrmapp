# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 311
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the unified calendar view that displays events from both the CRM and the user's connected Google Calendar.
# Details:
This task focuses on reading data from multiple sources and presenting it in a single, coherent user interface.

# Test Strategy:
Manually create one event in your `calendar_events` table for today. Create a separate, different event in your actual Google Calendar for tomorrow. Navigate to the `/calendar` page in the app. Verify you can see both events displayed correctly on their respective days.
