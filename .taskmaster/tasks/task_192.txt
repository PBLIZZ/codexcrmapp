# Title: Integrate Shadcn UI components for authentication forms
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Research and implement Shadcn UI components for the authentication forms, including Card, Input, Button, and Label components.
# Details:
1. Install Shadcn UI if not already present in the project
   ```bash
   npm install shadcn-ui
   # or
   yarn add shadcn-ui
   ```
2. Research Shadcn UI authentication templates as a starting point
3. Identify and implement the following components:
   - Card component for form containers
   - Input component for form fields
   - Button component for actions
   - Label component for input labels
4. Configure components to support the required styling:
   - Text color: `text-teal-800`
   - Accent color: `text-orange-500`
   - Form background: `bg-white` or `bg-gray-50`
5. Ensure components support accessibility requirements

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify components render correctly in different browsers
2. Test component styling against design requirements
3. Verify accessibility features (keyboard navigation, screen reader support)
4. Test responsive behavior on different screen sizes
5. Ensure components integrate properly with form validation
