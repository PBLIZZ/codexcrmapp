# Title: Update pnpm-workspace.yaml for new packages
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 245, 247
# Priority: medium
# Description: Update the pnpm-workspace.yaml file to recognize the new packages/config and packages/auth packages in the monorepo
# Details:
1. Add packages/config and packages/auth to the pnpm-workspace.yaml packages array
2. Ensure proper glob patterns are used for package discovery
3. Verify workspace configuration follows PNPM v8+ best practices
4. Test that pnpm install recognizes new packages
```

Ensure all new packages have proper package.json with correct naming convention

# Test Strategy:
Run pnpm install and verify new packages are recognized, check pnpm list shows new packages, and ensure cross-package imports work correctly
