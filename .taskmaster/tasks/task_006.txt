## 2. Design Component Architecture and File Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Establish the component library architecture with proper file organization, barrel exports, and component composition patterns following atomic design principles within the monorepo structure.
### Details:
Create component directory structure under '@/components/ui' with atoms, molecules, and organisms folders. Implement barrel exports with proper TypeScript declarations. Design component composition patterns using compound components and render props. Setup component variants system using class-variance-authority. Create base component interfaces and prop types with proper generic constraints.

## 3. Implement Accessibility Standards and ARIA Support [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Integrate comprehensive accessibility features including ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, focus management, and screen reader support across all UI components.
### Details:
Implement WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all components. Add proper ARIA labels, roles, and states using @radix-ui/react-* primitives. Setup keyboard navigation patterns with focus trapping and restoration. Implement screen reader announcements for dynamic content changes. Add color contrast validation and high contrast mode support. Create accessibility testing utilities and automated a11y checks.

## 4. Setup Testing Infrastructure and Component Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3
### Description: Establish comprehensive testing infrastructure including unit tests, integration tests, visual regression tests, and accessibility testing for all UI components.
### Details:
Configure Jest and React Testing Library with proper setup for Next.js App Router. Implement component testing patterns with proper mocking of tRPC and Supabase dependencies. Setup Chromatic for visual regression testing integrated with Storybook. Configure axe-core for automated accessibility testing. Create test utilities for component rendering with providers and theme context. Setup coverage reporting with minimum thresholds.

## 5. Create Documentation System with Interactive Examples [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2, 6.3, 6.4
### Description: Build comprehensive documentation system using Storybook with interactive examples, API documentation, and usage guidelines for each component.
### Details:
Configure Storybook with proper addon ecosystem including docs, controls, a11y, and viewport addons. Create comprehensive stories for each component covering all variants and states. Implement MDX documentation with code examples and best practices. Setup automatic prop documentation generation from TypeScript interfaces. Create design tokens documentation and theme customization guides. Implement search functionality and component categorization.

## 6. Build and Distribution Pipeline Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.5
### Description: Implement build and distribution pipeline for the component library including bundling, tree-shaking optimization, and package publishing workflow.
### Details:
Configure build pipeline using tsup for efficient bundling with proper tree-shaking support. Setup dual package.json exports for ESM and CommonJS compatibility. Implement CSS extraction and optimization for Tailwind classes. Create automated versioning using semantic-release with conventional commits. Setup npm package publishing workflow with proper scoping and access controls. Configure bundle analysis and size monitoring.

## 7. Version Control and Contribution Workflow [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.6
### Description: Establish version control workflow, contribution guidelines, and automated quality gates for component library development and maintenance.
### Details:
Setup GitHub Actions workflows for automated testing, building, and deployment. Implement branch protection rules with required status checks. Create contribution guidelines with component development standards and review process. Setup automated dependency updates using Dependabot. Implement conventional commit enforcement with commitlint. Create issue and pull request templates for component requests and bug reports.

## 8. Performance Optimization and Bundle Analysis [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.7
### Description: Implement performance optimization strategies including code splitting, lazy loading, bundle analysis, and runtime performance monitoring for the component library.
### Details:
Implement dynamic imports and code splitting for large components. Setup bundle analysis with webpack-bundle-analyzer and size-limit for CI/CD integration. Optimize component rendering with React.memo and useMemo where appropriate. Implement virtual scrolling for large lists and tables. Setup performance monitoring with Core Web Vitals tracking. Create performance budgets and automated alerts for bundle size increases.
