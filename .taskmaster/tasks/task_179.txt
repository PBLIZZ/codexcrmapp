# Task ID: 179
# Title: Implement Database Operations for Contact Import
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 170, 172
# Priority: high
# Description: Create optimized database operations to efficiently insert new contacts and update existing ones during the CSV import process.
# Details:
Develop database operations that:

1. **For new contacts**:
   - Prepare bulk insert operations for efficiency
   - Ensure all required fields are populated
   - Associate with the current user's ID
   - Handle tag creation/association

2. **For existing contacts (when overwrite is selected)**:
   - Prepare bulk update operations
   - Update only the fields present in the CSV
   - Maintain created_at timestamps
   - Update modified_at timestamps
   - Handle tag updates appropriately

3. **Optimization techniques**:
   - Use database transactions to ensure atomicity
   - Implement batching for very large imports (e.g., process 500 records at a time)
   - Use prepared statements for performance
   - Consider using database-specific bulk operations where available

4. **Error handling**:
   - Catch and log specific database errors
   - Provide meaningful error messages for common issues
   - Implement retry logic for transient errors
   - Roll back transactions on critical errors

Ensure the operations are compatible with the current database schema and constraints. Document any assumptions about the database structure.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for database operations with various scenarios. Test new contact creation and existing contact updates. Verify transaction behavior and rollback on errors. Test with large datasets to ensure performance. Verify all fields are correctly stored in the database. Test edge cases like very long text fields and special characters.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement New Contact Bulk Insert Operations [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement efficient bulk insert operations for new contacts in the database
### Details:
Create a system to handle bulk inserts of new contacts with the following components: 1) Data validation and preprocessing before insertion, 2) Database-specific bulk insert optimizations (e.g., prepared statements, COPY commands), 3) Performance benchmarking for different batch sizes, 4) Memory usage optimization for large datasets

## 2. Implement Existing Contact Update Operations [pending]
### Dependencies: 179.1
### Description: Design and implement efficient update operations for existing contacts in the database
### Details:
Develop a system to handle updates to existing contacts with: 1) Efficient lookup mechanisms to identify existing records, 2) Differential update logic to only modify changed fields, 3) Optimistic locking strategy to handle concurrent updates, 4) Update verification and conflict resolution mechanisms

## 3. Implement Transaction and Batching Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 179.1, 179.2
### Description: Optimize database operations using transactions and batching strategies
### Details:
Implement transaction and batching optimizations including: 1) Configurable transaction boundaries for different operation types, 2) Dynamic batch sizing based on operation complexity and dataset size, 3) Connection pooling configuration for optimal throughput, 4) Retry logic for transaction failures with exponential backoff

## 4. Implement Error Handling and Recovery Strategies [pending]
### Dependencies: 179.3
### Description: Design and implement comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms for database operations
### Details:
Create robust error handling and recovery strategies including: 1) Detailed error logging with contextual information, 2) Categorization of errors (transient vs. permanent), 3) Partial success handling for batch operations, 4) Automated recovery procedures for common failure scenarios, 5) Circuit breaker pattern implementation for database connection issues
