# Task ID: 270
# Title: Configure tRPC 11 with Proper Procedure Naming
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 267
# Priority: high
# Description: Setup tRPC 11 with camelCase procedures and PascalCase input/output schemas following naming conventions
# Details:
Install @trpc/server@11, @trpc/client@11, @trpc/next@11, and @trpc/react-query@11. Create server/routers with camelCase naming: userRouter, postRouter, authRouter. Implement procedures with descriptive verbs: getUser, createUser, updateUser, deleteUser. Use Zod for input validation with PascalCase schemas: CreateUserInput, UpdateUserInput. Setup tRPC context with proper typing. Configure Next.js API handler at app/api/trpc/[trpc]/route.ts. Implement proper error handling and middleware.

# Test Strategy:
Test all tRPC procedures with various inputs. Verify type safety between client and server. Test error handling and validation. Use tRPC panel for API testing during development.
