# Task ID: 266
# Title: Setup ESLint and Prettier with Naming Convention Rules
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Configure ESLint and Prettier with specific naming convention rules to enforce consistency across the codebase
# Details:
Install and configure ESLint with @typescript-eslint/naming-convention rules. Setup Prettier for consistent formatting. Create .eslintrc.js with rules for camelCase variables, PascalCase components, snake_case database fields, and kebab-case file/folder names. Configure pre-commit hooks using husky and lint-staged to enforce rules. Example ESLint config: { '@typescript-eslint/naming-convention': [{ selector: 'variableLike', format: ['camelCase'] }, { selector: 'typeLike', format: ['PascalCase'] }] }

# Test Strategy:
Run ESLint on sample files with various naming patterns to verify rules are enforced. Test pre-commit hooks by attempting commits with naming violations.
