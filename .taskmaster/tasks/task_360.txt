# Task ID: 360
# Title: Audit Server Components for Old Supabase Patterns
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 359
# Priority: medium
# Description: Identify all Server Components in apps/web that use old Supabase patterns
# Details:
1. Search in the `apps/web/app` directory for all `.tsx` files that do NOT have `'use client'` directive
2. Look for files that:
   - Import from `@/lib/supabase/server` or similar
   - Use `createServerSupabaseClient()` or similar
   - Have `supabase.from('table_name')` calls
   - Use `async/await` for data fetching
3. Create a list of all such files with their current import statements and data fetching patterns
4. Do not modify any code, only document findings

# Test Strategy:
1. Provide a complete list of affected files
2. Show the specific lines that need to be changed
3. Confirm no Server Components were missed
