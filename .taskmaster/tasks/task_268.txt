# Task ID: 268
# Title: Implement Next.js 15 App Router File Structure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 266
# Priority: high
# Description: Create proper Next.js App Router file structure following kebab-case for routes and required file naming conventions
# Details:
Create app directory structure with proper naming: app/page.tsx, app/layout.tsx, app/loading.tsx, app/error.tsx, app/not-found.tsx. Create route segments using kebab-case: app/user-profile/[user-id]/page.tsx, app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx. Implement dynamic routes with proper bracket notation. Create API routes as app/api/users/route.ts. Use Next.js 15 features like partial prerendering and improved caching. Ensure all special files use exact lowercase naming as required by App Router.

# Test Strategy:
Test routing by navigating to all defined routes. Verify dynamic routes work with various parameters. Test loading, error, and not-found states. Use Next.js development tools to verify proper file recognition.
