# Task ID: 245
# Title: Create packages/config for shared constants
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a new package at packages/config to house shared application constants including route paths and authentication-related constants
# Details:
1. Create packages/config directory structure with package.json, tsconfig.json, and index.ts
2. Create paths.ts file exporting AUTH_PAGES array, SIGN_IN_PATH, and DASHBOARD_PATH constants
3. Set up proper TypeScript configuration with module resolution
4. Export all constants from index.ts for easy importing
5. Use modern ES modules with proper type definitions

# Test Strategy:
Verify package can be imported in other packages, constants are properly typed and exported, and TypeScript compilation succeeds without errors
