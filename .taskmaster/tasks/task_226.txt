# Task ID: 226
# Title: Contact Relationship Hub - List View
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 223, 224, 215
# Priority: high
# Description: Create enhanced contact list with customizable columns, filtering, and bulk actions
# Details:
Build contact list interface with: 1) Data table using @tanstack/react-table v8 with sorting, filtering, pagination 2) Customizable column visibility and ordering 3) Bulk action toolbar (email, tag, delete) 4) Advanced filtering by tags, last contact date, session history 5) Search functionality with debounced input 6) Export functionality to CSV/Excel. Implement virtual scrolling for large datasets and optimize for performance with proper memoization.
