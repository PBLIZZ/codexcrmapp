# Task ID: 257
# Title: Refactor Navbar.tsx into Header.tsx
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 256
# Priority: high
# Description: Rename Navbar.tsx to Header.tsx and refactor it to be the primary desktop header, delegating mobile concerns to the new MobileMenu component.
# Details:
1. Rename the file from apps/web/components/layout/Navbar.tsx to Header.tsx
2. Update the component's function name from Navbar to Header
3. Remove all mobile Sheet JSX that was extracted to MobileMenu
4. Import and render the new MobileMenu component
5. Refactor the component to focus on desktop header responsibilities

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify the component renders correctly with all expected elements
2. Test that the MobileMenu component is properly imported and rendered
3. Ensure desktop navigation links are displayed correctly and only on desktop viewports
4. Test that the user profile and settings buttons are functional
5. Verify the header is sticky and has the correct z-index
6. Test that all links have the correct href attributes
7. Update any imports in other files that referenced Navbar.tsx to now use Header.tsx
