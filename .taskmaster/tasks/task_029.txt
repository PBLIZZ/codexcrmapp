# Task ID: 29
# Title: Feature: Google OAuth Sign-in Fix & Implementation
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 54, 4
# Priority: critical
# Description: CRITICAL BLOCKER: Fix Google OAuth sign-in issue that is currently preventing the entire application from loading. This task blocks ALL other development work and must be addressed immediately.
# Details:
The current Google OAuth implementation with Supabase in Next.js App Router is causing a critical application failure. Recent attempted fixes have worsened the situation. The issue appears to be related to cookie handling with the Supabase SSR client.

Approach:
1. Immediately roll back recent changes that exacerbated the issue to restore basic application functionality
2. Diagnose the root cause of the OAuth integration failure
3. Implement a properly tested solution for Google OAuth with Supabase in Next.js App Router
4. Verify credentials and configuration in both Supabase and Google Cloud Console
5. Thoroughly test the solution before deploying to production

# Test Strategy:
1. Test application loading after rollback to confirm basic functionality is restored
2. Test OAuth flow in development environment with detailed logging
3. Test cookie handling specifically with the Supabase SSR client
4. Verify proper session management across page refreshes and navigation
5. Test on multiple browsers to ensure cross-browser compatibility
6. Perform end-to-end testing of the complete authentication flow
7. Verify proper error handling for failed authentication attempts
