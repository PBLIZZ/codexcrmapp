# Task ID: 294
# Title: Refactor App Router Components to Align with Next.js 15 Standards
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 287
# Priority: medium
# Description: Update app router files to Next.js 15 patterns with authentication flow and navigation optimization.
# Details:
Apply an AST transformation script to update `page.tsx` and `layout.tsx` files to Next.js 15 standards (e.g., export defaults, metadata) with special focus on application experience: proper metadata for protected/unprotected pages, loading states for authentication transitions, error boundaries for the 8 main sections, and performance optimization for sidebar navigation and nested routing. Ensure proper metadata for main sections, implement Suspense boundaries for data loading, and optimize routing for authentication flow efficiency. Enhance toast integration with Sonner for better user feedback. Run `npx next build` to ensure no routing errors. Output a JSON change log with user experience improvements.

# Test Strategy:
Run `npx next build` to confirm no errors with special validation for authentication flow and section navigation. Check the JSON report for successful transformations and user experience enhancements.
