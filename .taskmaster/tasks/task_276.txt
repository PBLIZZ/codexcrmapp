# Title: Finalize MainLayout.tsx for Floating Sidebar
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Modify the main layout to support the 'floating' sidebar aesthetic by adding padding around the SidebarInset component.
# Details:
1. Open `apps/web/components/layout/MainLayout.tsx`
2. Locate the root div element
3. Add a background color or gradient (e.g., `bg-muted/40`) to create contrast for the floating elements
4. Find the `<SidebarInset>` component
5. Add padding classes (e.g., `p-2` or `p-4`) to create margin between the sidebar content and the edges
6. Ensure the layout maintains responsiveness across different screen sizes
7. Test the visual appearance to confirm the floating effect is achieved

# Test Strategy:
1. Visually inspect the layout in different viewport sizes to ensure the floating effect is consistent
2. Verify that the sidebar appears to float above the background
3. Check that the padding is applied correctly and creates the intended visual separation
4. Test in multiple browsers to ensure cross-browser compatibility
