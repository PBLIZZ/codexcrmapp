# Task ID: 295
# Title: Migrate React Components to Leverage React 19 Features
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Update React components to use React 19 features with authentication and navigation optimization.
# Details:
Scan `src/components/**` files for legacy patterns with priority on core application components: authentication forms (login/signup), protected page wrappers, sidebar navigation components (AppSidebarController, section sidebars), main layout components (MainLayout, AppContent), dashboard widgets, and toast notification implementations. Run an automated transformation to update hooks and patterns to React 19 with focus on Server Components for improved loading, Suspense integration for protected page transitions, concurrent features for better navigation responsiveness, and optimized state management for authentication flow. Implement React 19 form actions for auth forms and enhance Sonner toast integration. Output a JSON change log identifying components updated with application-specific optimizations.

# Test Strategy:
Run unit tests and static analysis to confirm React 19 compliance with authentication and navigation validation. Check the change log for updated components and application-specific optimizations.
