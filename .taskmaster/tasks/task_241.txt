# Task ID: 241
# Title: Database Migration Scripts with Rollback and Version Control
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 212, 222
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create comprehensive database migration scripts with rollback capabilities, version tracking, and environment-specific configurations to handle schema changes safely across development, staging, and production environments.
# Details:
Implement a robust database migration system with the following components:

1. **Migration Script Structure**:
   - Create numbered migration files (e.g., 001_initial_schema.sql, 002_add_ai_features.sql)
   - Each migration file contains both UP (forward) and DOWN (rollback) operations
   - Include metadata headers with version, description, author, and timestamp
   - Use transaction blocks to ensure atomicity

2. **Version Control System**:
   - Create schema_migrations table to track applied migrations
   - Store migration version, applied_at timestamp, and checksum for integrity
   - Implement migration status tracking (pending, applied, failed, rolled_back)
   - Add migration dependency tracking for complex schema changes

3. **Environment-Specific Configurations**:
   - Create separate configuration files for dev/staging/production
   - Include environment-specific connection strings and parameters
   - Implement conditional logic for environment-specific data seeding
   - Support different backup strategies per environment

4. **Safety Mechanisms**:
   - Implement dry-run mode to preview changes without execution
   - Add data backup procedures before destructive operations
   - Include rollback time limits and dependency checks
   - Implement idempotent operations using IF EXISTS/IF NOT EXISTS
   - Add data validation checks before and after migrations

5. **Migration Tools**:
   - Create CLI tool for running migrations (migrate up/down/status)
   - Implement automatic rollback on failure
   - Add migration locking to prevent concurrent executions
   - Include progress reporting and detailed logging

6. **Integration with Existing Schema**:
   - Create migrations for the AI-enhanced CRM schema changes from Tasks 212/222
   - Handle existing data preservation during schema modifications
   - Implement gradual migration strategies for large datasets

# Test Strategy:
1. **Unit Testing**: Test individual migration scripts in isolated database instances, verify both forward and rollback operations execute correctly, validate idempotent behavior by running migrations multiple times. 2. **Integration Testing**: Test complete migration sequences from clean database to current schema, verify rollback chains work in reverse order, test environment-specific configurations across dev/staging/production. 3. **Data Integrity Testing**: Populate test database with sample data, run migrations and verify data preservation, test rollback operations maintain data consistency, validate foreign key constraints and indexes. 4. **Failure Scenario Testing**: Simulate migration failures at various points, verify automatic rollback mechanisms, test recovery from partial migration states, validate locking mechanisms prevent concurrent executions. 5. **Performance Testing**: Measure migration execution times on large datasets, test backup and restore procedures, validate migration performance across different environments. 6. **Production Readiness**: Test complete deployment pipeline with migration scripts, verify monitoring and alerting for migration status, validate backup procedures before production deployment.
