# Web Application Architecture

This document outlines the architecture and component structure of the web application.

## Core Layout Components

### MainLayout

The `MainLayout` component is the root layout for the application. It provides the overall structure including the floating sidebar and main content area.

**Location:** `components/layout/MainLayout.tsx`

### AppContent

The `AppContent` component renders the main content area of the application, including the header and the page content.

**Location:** `components/layout/AppContent.tsx`

### AppSidebarController

The `AppSidebarController` determines which sidebar to display based on the current route. It dynamically imports the appropriate sidebar component.

**Location:** `components/layout/AppSidebarController.tsx`

### PageHeader

The `PageHeader` component displays the page title, breadcrumbs, and any page-specific actions.

**Location:** `components/layout/PageHeader.tsx`

## File Structure

The application follows these conventions:

- Components use PascalCase for both filenames and component names
- Page components are defined in `page.tsx` files within their respective route directories
- Shared UI components are in `components/ui/`
- Layout components are in `components/layout/`
- Section-specific components are organized in directories under their respective route folders

## Adding a New Section

To add a new section to the application:

1. Create a new directory for the section under `app/` (e.g., `app/new-section/`)
2. Create a `page.tsx` file in this directory
3. Create a sidebar component in `components/layout/sidebars/NewSectionSidebar.tsx`
4. Add the new section to the `AppSidebarController` component
5. Add the section to the navigation in `components/layout/MainSectionNav.tsx`

## Dashboard Widgets

The dashboard uses a modular widget system. Widgets are self-contained components that display specific information or functionality.

**Location:** `app/dashboard/components/widgets/`

To add a new widget:

1. Create a new component in the widgets directory
2. Import and add it to the grid in `DashboardWidgets.tsx`
```

3. Ensure the README is comprehensive but concise, focusing on the most important architectural aspects
4. Include any additional information that would be helpful for new developers joining the project

# Test Strategy:
1. Review the README for clarity, completeness, and accuracy
2. Verify that all key components and architectural concepts are documented
3. Check that the file structure conventions are clearly explained
4. Ensure the instructions for adding new sections are complete and easy to follow
5. Have another team member review the documentation for any gaps or unclear explanations
