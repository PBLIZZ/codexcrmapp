# Task ID: 285
# Title: Scan Monorepo File System for Code Files and Directory Structure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Run CLI commands to collect file paths matching specified patterns and aggregate into a JSON report with focus on CodexApp core components.
# Details:
Execute `find . -type f -name '*.tsx'` and `find app -type f -name 'page.tsx'` commands to gather file paths. Aggregate results into a JSON file with keys for each file pattern. Priority focus on the 8 main sections: Dashboard, Contacts, Tasks, Messages, Calendar, Marketing, Analytics, Settings. Also prioritize core components: layout.tsx, appcontent.tsx, mainlayout.tsx, appsidebarcontroller.tsx, omnibot.tsx, mainsectionnav.tsx, and section sidebars (contactssection, settingssidebar, etc.). The JSON should include arrays of file paths for each pattern with special categorization for business-critical vs generic components.

# Test Strategy:
Confirm the JSON report contains a verified list of files by comparing with manual `find` command results. Ensure counts match and core application components are properly categorized.
