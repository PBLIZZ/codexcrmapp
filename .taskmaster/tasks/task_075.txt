# Subtasks:
## 1. Design API Connection Manager Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the architectural design for the API Connection Manager that will handle all external API integrations
### Details:
Define the core components of the API Connection Manager including connection pooling, authentication handling, request/response formatting, error handling, and retry logic. Create class diagrams and sequence diagrams to illustrate the architecture. Consider scalability, security, and performance requirements.

## 2. Implement Core API Connection Manager [pending]
### Dependencies: 75.1
### Description: Develop the core functionality of the API Connection Manager based on the architectural design
### Details:
Implement the base classes and interfaces for the connection manager. Include functionality for connection establishment, authentication, request formatting, response parsing, error handling, and connection pooling. Write comprehensive unit tests to ensure reliability. Document the API for developer usage.

## 3. Develop Direct API Integrations [pending]
### Dependencies: 75.2
### Description: Create specific integrations with external APIs using the Connection Manager
### Details:
Implement concrete integration classes for each required external API. Configure authentication methods specific to each API. Create data mapping between the application's data model and each API's required format. Implement specialized error handling for each integration. Write integration tests to verify end-to-end functionality.
