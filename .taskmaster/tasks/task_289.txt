# Task ID: 289
# Title: Establish a Performance Baseline for the Current Monorepo Build
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build the Next.js application with profiling to capture baseline performance metrics focusing on core user journey scenarios.
# Details:
Run `npx next build --profile` to generate performance metrics (build time, bundle size, TTI). Extract and structure the profiling data into a JSON baseline report with special focus on critical user scenarios: authentication flow (login → dashboard redirect), sidebar navigation responsiveness, protected page loading, main section transitions (Dashboard → Contacts → Tasks, etc.), and core component rendering (AppSidebarController, MainLayout, Omnibot). Include metrics for nested routing performance and toast notification responsiveness.

# Test Strategy:
Confirm the JSON report includes key metrics with core user journey benchmarks. Ensure baseline values are recorded for authentication flow and main section navigation, stored securely for future comparison.
