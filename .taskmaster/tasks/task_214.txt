# Task ID: 214
# Title: Develop Dashboard Module with Business Health Visualization
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 212, 213, 224, 225
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the dashboard module that serves as the practitioner's 'second brain' with business health visualization, upcoming activities, and AI task delegation panel.
# Details:
Create a comprehensive dashboard with the following features:

1. Business health visualization cards showing:
   - Upcoming sessions counter with time-based grouping
   - Retention risk indicators based on client engagement
   - Goal progress tracking for retreats, workshops, and conversions
2. AI task delegation panel with approval workflow
3. Calendar integration preview showing today's and upcoming appointments
4. Quick action buttons for common tasks
5. Wellness-specific metrics display

Implementation details:
- Use Next.js App Router for page structure
- Implement React Server Components for static parts and Client Components for interactive elements
- Use tRPC procedures to fetch dashboard data
- Implement data fetching with SWR or React Query for real-time updates
- Create responsive grid layout using Tailwind CSS grid system
- Use Chart.js or Recharts for data visualization

Example dashboard layout:
```tsx
// app/dashboard/page.tsx
import { Suspense } from 'react';
import { MetricCard } from '@/components/ui/metric-card';
import { CalendarPreview } from '@/components/dashboard/calendar-preview';
import { AiTaskPanel } from '@/components/dashboard/ai-task-panel';
import { QuickActions } from '@/components/dashboard/quick-actions';
import { BusinessMetrics } from '@/components/dashboard/business-metrics';
import { DashboardSkeleton } from '@/components/skeletons/dashboard-skeleton';

export default function DashboardPage() {
  return (
    <div className="container mx-auto p-6">
      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Dashboard</h1>
      
      <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-6 mb-6">
        <Suspense fallback={<DashboardSkeleton />}>
          <BusinessMetrics />
        </Suspense>
      </div>
      
      <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-6">
        <div className="md:col-span-2">
          <Suspense fallback={<DashboardSkeleton />}>
            <AiTaskPanel />
          </Suspense>
        </div>
        <div>
          <Suspense fallback={<DashboardSkeleton />}>
            <CalendarPreview />
          </Suspense>
          <QuickActions className="mt-6" />
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for individual dashboard components using React Testing Library
2. Integration tests for data fetching with tRPC mocks
3. End-to-end tests using Playwright or Cypress to verify dashboard functionality
4. Performance testing for initial load and data refresh
5. Responsive design testing across different viewport sizes
6. Accessibility testing for all dashboard components
7. User acceptance testing with wellness professionals to validate usefulness of metrics
