# Task ID: 234
# Title: Email Service Integration Hub
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 232
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build unified email service integration supporting multiple providers
# Details:
Implement email integration with: 1) Gmail API integration (already covered in Google services) 2) MailChimp API v3 for marketing campaigns 3) SendGrid API for transactional emails 4) Custom SMTP configuration support 5) Email template management 6) Campaign tracking and analytics 7) Unified interface for different providers. Use adapter pattern for provider abstraction and implement proper email validation.

# Test Strategy:
Multi-provider email sending testing, template rendering validation, campaign tracking verification, SMTP configuration testing, and delivery status monitoring

# Subtasks:
## 1. Provider Abstraction Layer [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the core abstraction layer that defines common interfaces and contracts for email service providers
### Details:
Create abstract base classes, interfaces, and common data structures that all email providers must implement. Define standard methods for sending emails, managing templates, handling responses, and error handling across different providers.

## 2. MailChimp Integration [pending]
