# Task ID: 259
# Title: Create Shared UserNav Component
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a UserNav.tsx component that displays the current user's avatar and name/email, to be reused across different sidebars.
# Details:
1. Create a new file at apps/web/components/layout/UserNav.tsx
2. Use the useAuth() hook to fetch user data
3. Design a self-contained component that displays user avatar and information
4. Ensure it can be easily placed at the bottom of any sidebar

# Test Strategy:
1. Render the UserNav component with a mocked useAuth hook
2. Test with different user data scenarios (full profile, missing avatar, etc.)
3. Verify the component correctly displays user name, email, and avatar
4. Test that the dropdown menu opens when clicked
5. Verify all dropdown menu items are present and functional
6. Test that the signOut function is called when the Log out option is clicked
7. Ensure the component returns null when no user is present
