# Task ID: 299
# Title: Verify Performance Improvements Against Baselines
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 289, 297
# Priority: high
# Description: Compare post-refactoring performance metrics with baseline focusing on core user experience improvements.
# Details:
Run `npx next build --profile` to get current metrics. Compare with baseline (Task 289) in a JSON report showing percentage improvements in bundle size, TTI, FCP, and application-specific metrics: authentication flow speed, sidebar navigation responsiveness, protected page loading time, section transition performance, toast notification speed, and Omnibot loading efficiency. Validate that core user workflows show measurable performance gains and overall user experience improvements.

# Test Strategy:
Confirm improvements meet targets (e.g., 10% bundle reduction, 15% faster authentication flow) with special focus on core user experience metrics. Validate metrics are comparable to baseline methodology and show meaningful improvements for user-facing operations.
