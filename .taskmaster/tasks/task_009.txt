# Task ID: 9
# Title: Feature: AI-Powered Contact Enrichment
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 35, 7, 45
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement AI contact enrichment using OpenRouter/LLMs. Includes OpenRouter client, enrichment service (prompts, parsing, status tracking), tRPC procedures, UI for status/trigger. (Corresponds to original Task 9, focused on enrichment)
# Details:


# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up OpenRouter client integration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the integration with OpenRouter API to access LLM capabilities for contact enrichment
### Details:
Create a client service that handles authentication, request formatting, and communication with OpenRouter API. Include configuration for API keys, model selection, and request parameters. Ensure the client can handle rate limits and usage tracking.

## 2. Design effective prompts for contact enrichment [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Create structured prompts that will extract relevant information from partial contact data
### Details:
Research and develop prompt templates that guide the LLM to enrich contact information effectively. Include instructions for formatting responses consistently, handling uncertain information, and maximizing accuracy. Test prompts with various contact scenarios to ensure quality results.

## 3. Implement enrichment service with status tracking [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2
### Description: Build a service layer that manages the enrichment process and tracks the status of each request
### Details:
Create a service that coordinates the enrichment workflow, including queuing requests, tracking progress, and storing results. Implement a status tracking system with states like 'pending', 'processing', 'completed', and 'failed'. Include timestamps and metadata for each enrichment request.

## 4. Create response parsing logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2, 9.3
### Description: Develop logic to parse and validate AI-generated responses into structured contact data
### Details:
Build parsers that extract structured data from LLM responses. Implement validation to ensure data quality and consistency. Handle edge cases like incomplete or ambiguous responses. Create a normalized data structure that can be merged with existing contact information.

## 5. Build tRPC procedures for enrichment operations [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.3, 9.4
### Description: Implement tRPC endpoints to trigger enrichment and retrieve results
### Details:
Create tRPC procedures for initiating contact enrichment, checking status, retrieving results, and canceling requests. Include proper authentication, validation, and error handling. Design the API to support both individual and batch enrichment operations.

## 6. Develop UI components for enrichment workflow [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.5
### Description: Create user interface elements for triggering enrichment and displaying status/results
### Details:
Design and implement UI components including enrichment buttons, status indicators, progress displays, and result previews. Create modals for confirming enrichment actions and reviewing suggested changes. Ensure the UI provides clear feedback about the enrichment process and costs.

## 7. Implement error handling and retry mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.3, 9.5
### Description: Build robust error handling and retry logic for failed enrichment attempts
### Details:
Develop comprehensive error handling for API failures, timeout issues, and invalid responses. Implement intelligent retry mechanisms with exponential backoff. Create user-friendly error messages and recovery options. Add logging for debugging and monitoring purposes.
