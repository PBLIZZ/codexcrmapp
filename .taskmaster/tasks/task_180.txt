# Task ID: 180
# Title: Add Notification System for Import Results
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 172, 175
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement a notification system to inform users about the results of their CSV import operations using the Sonner toast system.
# Details:
Develop a notification system that:

1. **Shows toast notifications for**:
   - Import started: "Import process started. We'll notify you when it's complete."
   - Import completed: "Import complete! X contacts imported, Y updated, Z errors."
   - Import failed: "Import failed. Please check the error details."

2. **Implements different notification types**:
   - Success notifications (green) for successful imports
   - Info notifications (blue) for in-progress status
   - Warning notifications (yellow) for partial success with some errors
   - Error notifications (red) for failed imports

3. **Includes appropriate actions**:
   - Link to view imported contacts
   - Link to download error report when applicable
   - Dismiss button

4. **Handles notification timing**:
   - Show notifications for an appropriate duration based on content
   - Allow manual dismissal
   - Prevent notification overload for sequential operations

Integrate with the existing Sonner toast system as mentioned in the PRD. Ensure notifications are responsive and accessible. Consider adding subtle animation for better user experience.

# Test Strategy:
Test all notification types and scenarios. Verify correct styling and content for each notification type. Test action links functionality. Verify notifications appear and disappear as expected. Test accessibility of notifications. Ensure notifications work correctly on all supported browsers and devices.
