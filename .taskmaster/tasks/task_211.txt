# Task ID: 211
# Title: Fix, Centralize, and Standardize Logout Functionality
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Consolidate all sign-out functionality into a single component and standardize all terminology from 'Sign Out' to 'Logout'. This will resolve a critical bug (TRPCClientError: UNAUTHORIZED) and enforce consistent naming conventions (Login/Logout/Signup) across the application.
# Details:
The primary goal is to fix a logout race condition by using a Server Action that handles session invalidation and an immediate server-side redirect. As part of this fix, all related code—components, functions, variables, and user-facing text—will be refactored from 'Sign Out' or 'signout' to 'Logout'. This will create a single, robust, and consistently named `LogoutButton` component.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that logging out from all application entry points redirects the user to the login page without any console errors. Confirm that all user-facing text, component names, and function names have been updated from 'Sign Out' to 'Logout'.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement the `logout` Server Action [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a dedicated Server Action named `logout` that securely signs the user out and performs an immediate server-side redirect to the login page.
### Details:


## 2. Create a Reusable `LogoutButton` Component [pending]
### Dependencies: 211.1
### Description: Develop a form-based client component named `LogoutButton` that triggers the `logout` Server Action. It should be styled with Shadcn UI and manage its own pending state.
### Details:


## 3. Integrate `LogoutButton` into all UI Surfaces [pending]
### Dependencies: 211.2
### Description: Replace existing sign-out logic and buttons in the main navigation's user dropdown and the account settings page with the new reusable `LogoutButton` component.
### Details:


## 4. Standardize All Terminology to 'Logout' [pending]
### Dependencies: 211.3
### Description: Perform a comprehensive, case-insensitive search across the entire codebase for 'Sign Out' and 'signout', refactoring all instances (variables, comments, log messages, etc.) to 'Logout'.
### Details:


## 5. Remove Redundant Sign-Out Implementations [pending]
### Dependencies: 211.4
### Description: Audit the codebase to find and delete any old `SignOutButton` components, handler functions, or client-side API calls to ensure the new `logout` Server Action is the single source of truth.
### Details:


## 6. Final Verification and Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 211.5
### Description: Thoroughly test the end-to-end logout flow from all entry points to confirm the TRPCClientError is resolved and the user experience is seamless and consistent.
