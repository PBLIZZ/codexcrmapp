# Task ID: 233
# Title: Google Services Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 232
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement two-way sync with Google Calendar, Contacts, and Gmail using MCP client
# Details:
Create Google integration with: 1) Google Calendar API v3 integration for session scheduling 2) Google Contacts API for contact synchronization 3) Gmail API for email management and drafts 4) Two-way sync with conflict resolution 5) Incremental sync using change tokens 6) Batch operations for efficiency 7) OAuth 2.0 flow with proper scope management. Use Google APIs Node.js client library and implement proper error handling for API limits.

# Test Strategy:
Two-way sync validation, conflict resolution testing, incremental sync verification, OAuth flow testing, and API rate limit handling

# Subtasks:
## 1. OAuth Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication flow for Google APIs including token management, refresh handling, and secure credential storage
### Details:
Set up Google OAuth 2.0 client configuration, implement authorization code flow, handle token refresh automatically, store credentials securely, and manage authentication state across application sessions

## 2. Calendar API Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 233.1
### Description: Integrate Google Calendar API to read, create, update, and delete calendar events with proper error handling and rate limiting
### Details:
Implement Calendar API client, handle event CRUD operations, manage calendar permissions, implement pagination for large datasets, and add proper error handling for API rate limits and quota exceeded scenarios

## 3. Contacts API Sync [pending]
### Dependencies: 233.1
### Description: Implement Google Contacts API integration for synchronizing contact information with bidirectional data flow
### Details:
Set up People API client, implement contact retrieval and modification operations, handle contact groups and labels, manage contact photo synchronization, and implement proper data mapping between local and Google contact formats

## 4. Gmail Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 233.1
### Description: Integrate Gmail API for email synchronization, search, and management capabilities with proper scope handling
### Details:
Implement Gmail API client, handle email retrieval with filters and search, manage email labels and threads, implement attachment handling, and ensure proper scope management for different Gmail operations

## 5. Two-way Sync Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 233.2, 233.3, 233.4
### Description: Develop bidirectional synchronization logic to keep local data in sync with Google services while maintaining data integrity
### Details:
Implement change detection mechanisms, create sync scheduling system, handle incremental updates, manage sync state persistence, implement rollback mechanisms for failed syncs, and ensure data consistency across all integrated services

## 6. Conflict Resolution Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 233.5
### Description: Implement comprehensive conflict resolution strategies for handling data conflicts during synchronization processes
### Details:
Design conflict detection algorithms, implement resolution strategies (last-write-wins, user-choice, merge), create conflict logging and reporting, handle edge cases like simultaneous updates, and provide user interface for manual conflict resolution when automatic resolution fails
