# Task ID: 358
# Title: Project Phoenix: Verify Backend Foundation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Validate that the backend packages are correctly structured according to the latest architectural decisions
# Details:
Before starting the Project Phoenix integration, ensure:
1. `@codexcrm/api` correctly creates and exports its `appRouter` and `createContext` function
2. The `apps/web/app/api/trpc/[trpc]/route.ts` file is correctly set up to handle requests and pass them to the `appRouter`
3. Verify that the API endpoint is accessible and responds correctly to simple requests

# Test Strategy:
1. Check if the `@codexcrm/api` package exports the expected objects
2. Run a basic HTTP request against the tRPC API endpoint to verify it responds
3. Test a simple procedure call to confirm the full request-response cycle works
