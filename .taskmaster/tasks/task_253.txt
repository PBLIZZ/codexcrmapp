# Status: done
# Dependencies: 247, 252
# Priority: medium
# Description: Update the ClientProviders component in apps/web/app/providers-client.tsx to include the new AuthProvider as the top-level provider
# Details:
1. Import AuthProvider from @codexcrm/auth package
2. Wrap existing providers with AuthProvider as the outermost provider
3. Ensure proper provider hierarchy with AuthProvider > TRPCReactProvider
4. Maintain existing TanStack Query and other provider configurations
5. Test that all providers work together correctly

# Test Strategy:
Verify AuthProvider is the top-level provider, all existing functionality works, tRPC and TanStack Query integration remains functional, and no provider conflicts occur
