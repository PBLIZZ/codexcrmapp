# Task ID: 314
# Title: Epic 6: Implement AI Task Delegation Backend
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 301
# Priority: medium
# Description: Update the database schema and tRPC API to support AI task ownership.
# Details:
This task lays the backend groundwork for handing off tasks to the AI worker agent.

# Test Strategy:
Create a new 'AI Worker' user in the `auth.users` table. Find its UUID. Create a normal task; its `owner_id` should be your ID. Use an API client to call the new `task.delegateToAI` mutation with the task's ID. Query the database and confirm the task's `owner_id` has changed to the AI Worker's UUID.
