# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up GitHub Actions workflows [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create GitHub Actions workflow files to automate the CI/CD pipeline
### Details:
Create .github/workflows directory and implement YAML configuration files for different environments (development, staging, production). Define triggers for pull requests, merges to specific branches, and manual deployments. Include proper authentication for GitHub Actions to access required resources.

## 2. Configure automated testing in the CI pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1
### Description: Implement automated testing steps in the GitHub Actions workflows
### Details:
Add testing steps to the workflow including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. Configure test reporting and code coverage metrics. Set up conditional workflow steps to fail the pipeline if tests don't pass. Include caching mechanisms to speed up test runs.

## 3. Create build process scripts [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1, 20.2
### Description: Develop scripts to handle the application build process
### Details:
Create build scripts that compile the application, optimize assets, and prepare the deployment package. Implement environment-specific build configurations. Add validation steps to ensure build artifacts are correct before deployment. Configure proper caching of dependencies and build outputs.

## 4. Set up Vercel project with environments [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.3
### Description: Configure Vercel project with development, staging, and production environments
### Details:
Create Vercel project and configure environment variables for each deployment environment. Set up domain configurations and preview deployments for pull requests. Configure Vercel CLI for local testing and GitHub Actions integration. Implement environment-specific settings and feature flags.

## 5. Implement database migration handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.4
### Description: Create processes for safe database migrations during deployments
### Details:
Develop scripts to handle database schema migrations as part of the deployment process. Implement versioning for database schemas. Create backup procedures before migrations. Add validation steps to ensure migrations complete successfully. Configure rollback procedures for failed migrations.

## 6. Create monitoring and rollback procedures [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.4, 20.5
### Description: Implement monitoring solutions and procedures for rolling back failed deployments
### Details:
Set up monitoring tools to track application health after deployments. Create alerting for deployment failures or performance issues. Implement automated and manual rollback procedures. Document incident response processes. Configure deployment health checks and progressive rollout strategies.
