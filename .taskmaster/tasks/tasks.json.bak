Summary of Supabase Authentication Issue: After a new user confirms their email, the application middleware fails to recognize the authenticated user on the first redirect to a protected route (e.g., /dashboard). The supabase.auth.getUser() call in the middleware throws a User from sub claim in JWT does not exist error, causing the user to be redirected to /sign-in instead of being automatically logged in. Key Observations: The Supabase auth.users table updates correctly and immediately upon email confirmation. The /api/auth/callback route successfully exchanges the auth code for a session and sets the necessary cookies. The issue appears specifically when the middleware tries to validate the user via getUser() immediately after the callback redirect."

      "description": "Refactor the codebase to change absolute filepaths to relative paths to better align with the monorepo structure, improving maintainability and reducing import errors.",
      "details": "This task involves systematically updating file imports throughout the codebase to use relative paths instead of absolute paths, ensuring compatibility with the monorepo architecture:\n\n1. Identify all files using absolute paths:\n   - Scan the entire codebase for import statements using absolute paths (e.g., imports starting with '@/' or '/' or referencing packages by name)\n   - Focus on key directories: apps/web, packages/server, and shared libraries\n\n2. Establish consistent path resolution rules:\n   - For imports within the same package/app: Use relative paths (e.g., `import { Component } from '../components/Component'`)\n   - For imports across packages: Use package references defined in tsconfig paths (e.g., `import { type } from '@myapp/shared'`)\n\n3. Update import statements:\n   - Replace absolute paths with relative paths\n   - Example:\n     ```typescript\n     // Before\n     import { ContactForm } from '@/components/contacts/ContactForm';\n     \n     // After\n     import { ContactForm } from '../../components/contacts/ContactForm';\n     ```\n\n4. Update tsconfig.json files:\n   - Ensure path aliases are correctly configured in all tsconfig.json files\n   - Verify baseUrl and paths settings are consistent across packages\n\n5. Update build configurations:\n   - Ensure webpack, vite, or other bundler configurations properly resolve the relative paths\n   - Update any path-related plugins or settings\n\n6. Special considerations:\n   - Handle dynamic imports correctly\n   - Ensure test files maintain correct imports\n   - Update any path utilities or helper functions that construct file paths\n\n7. Documentation:\n   - Update documentation to reflect the new path resolution strategy\n   - Create guidelines for future development to maintain consistency",
      "testStrategy": "1. Static Analysis:\n   - Run ESLint with import/no-absolute-path rule enabled to verify no absolute paths remain\n   - Use TypeScript compiler to check for any type errors resulting from path changes\n\n2. Build Verification:\n   - Run the build process for all packages to ensure no build errors\n   - Verify that all imports are correctly resolved during build time\n\n3. Runtime Testing:\n   - Start the application and navigate through major features\n   - Verify that all components load correctly without console errors related to imports\n\n4. Cross-Package Testing:\n   - Test functionality that relies on imports between different packages\n   - Verify that shared components and utilities are correctly imported and function as expected\n\n5. CI/CD Pipeline:\n   - Ensure CI/CD pipeline successfully builds and tests the application\n   - Verify that deployment processes work correctly with the updated path structure\n\n6. Code Review:\n   - Have team members review the changes to ensure consistency\n   - Verify that the established path conventions are followed throughout\n\n7. Documentation Testing:\n   - Verify that any path examples in documentation are updated\n   - Test that developer onboarding processes work with the new path structure",
