## 4. Add Birthday (Month/Day) Field to Contacts [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create new `birthday_month` (integer) and `birthday_day` (integer) fields in the `contacts` (or `clients`) table in Supabase. Update the tRPC input/output schemas, and relevant forms/views to allow users to record and view contact birthdays (month and day only, year omitted for privacy/simplicity).
