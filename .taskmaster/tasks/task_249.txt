# Task ID: 249
# Title: Migrate apps/web from src/ directory structure to root-level
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Move all contents from apps/web/src to the root of apps/web directory following Next.js 15 App Router conventions
# Details:
1. Move apps/web/src to apps/web
2. Move apps/web/src/lib to apps/web/lib
3. Move any other directories from src/ to root level
6. Remove empty src/ directory
4. Ensure all internal imports still work after the move

Directory structure after migration:
```
apps/web/
├── app/
├── components/
├── lib/
├── hooks/
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
└── tailwind.config.js
```

# Test Strategy:
Verify all files moved correctly, no broken imports exist, Next.js can find all files in new locations, and application builds successfully
