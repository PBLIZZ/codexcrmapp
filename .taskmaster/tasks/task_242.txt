# Task ID: 242
# Title: Error Handling and User Feedback System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 224, 237, 238, 177, 175
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a comprehensive error handling and user feedback system across the application to provide clear, actionable messages for both system errors and user actions.
# Details:
Develop a robust error handling and user feedback system with the following components:

1. **Global Error Handling**:
   - Implement a centralized error handling service that captures and processes errors from all parts of the application
   - Create error severity levels (critical, error, warning, info)
   - Set up error logging to both client-side storage and server-side logs
   - Implement automatic error reporting to monitoring systems

2. **User-Facing Error Messages**:
   - Design a consistent toast/notification component with appropriate styling for different message types
   - Create a message queue system to handle multiple notifications
   - Implement auto-dismissal with configurable timeouts based on message importance
   - Add ability for users to manually dismiss notifications

3. **Form Validation Feedback**:
   - Enhance form validation with inline error messages
   - Implement real-time validation feedback where appropriate
   - Add field highlighting for invalid inputs
   - Provide clear instructions for correcting errors

4. **Success Confirmations**:
   - Design success confirmation messages for completed actions
   - Implement visual indicators for successful operations (checkmarks, animations)
   - Add progress indicators for longer operations

5. **Offline/Connectivity Handling**:
   - Detect and notify users of connectivity issues
   - Implement graceful degradation when offline
   - Provide clear recovery instructions

6. **Integration with Existing Components**:
   - Update all forms, import workflows, and authentication screens to use the new system
   - Ensure consistent error handling across the application

7. **Accessibility Considerations**:
   - Ensure all notifications are accessible (screen reader compatible)
   - Use appropriate ARIA attributes
   - Implement keyboard navigation for dismissing notifications

8. **Internationalization Support**:
   - Structure error messages for easy translation
   - Implement placeholder support for dynamic content in messages

# Test Strategy:
1. **Unit Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for the error handling service
   - Test message queue functionality
   - Verify proper error categorization and processing

2. **Component Testing**:
   - Test toast/notification components in isolation
   - Verify proper rendering of different message types
   - Test auto-dismissal and manual dismissal functionality
   - Ensure proper stacking/queuing of multiple notifications

3. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test error handling across form submissions
   - Verify API error responses are properly captured and displayed
   - Test offline mode error handling
   - Verify file import error handling

4. **End-to-End Testing**:
   - Create E2E tests that trigger various error conditions
   - Test user flows with validation errors
   - Verify success messages appear after completed actions

5. **Accessibility Testing**:
   - Test with screen readers to ensure notifications are properly announced
   - Verify keyboard navigation works for dismissing notifications
   - Check color contrast for different message types

6. **Cross-Browser Testing**:
   - Verify consistent behavior across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
   - Test on mobile browsers

7. **Manual Testing Scenarios**:
   - Simulate network failures during operations
   - Test with various form validation errors
   - Verify proper error handling during CSV import
   - Test authentication error scenarios
