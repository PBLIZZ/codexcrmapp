# Task ID: 199
# Title: Implement responsive design for authentication pages
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 193, 194
# Priority: medium
# Description: Ensure both Log In and Sign Up pages are fully responsive and provide a good user experience across different device sizes.
# Details:
1. Add responsive styling to both authentication pages:
   ```typescript
   <div className="flex min-h-screen items-center justify-center p-4 bg-teal-50">
     <div className="w-full max-w-md">
       <Card className="p-6 sm:p-8">
         {/* Form content */}
       </Card>
     </div>
   </div>
   ```
2. Adjust font sizes and spacing for different screen sizes:
   ```css
   .title {
     @apply text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold text-teal-800;
   }
   ```
3. Ensure form inputs and buttons scale appropriately
4. Test and adjust layout for mobile devices (320px width minimum)
5. Ensure touch targets are appropriately sized for mobile
6. Optimize logo size for different screen sizes

# Test Strategy:
1. Test on various device sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
2. Use browser dev tools to test specific breakpoints
3. Verify forms are usable on touch devices
4. Check for any overflow issues or horizontal scrolling
5. Test with different orientations (portrait/landscape)
6. Verify that all interactive elements are easily tappable on mobile
