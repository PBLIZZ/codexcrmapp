# Description: Create a container component that lays out the five primary dashboard widgets using a responsive CSS grid.
# Details:
1. Create a new file at `apps/web/app/dashboard/components/DashboardWidgets.tsx`
2. Import the five widget components (to be created in the next task)
3. Implement a responsive grid layout using Tailwind CSS:
```tsx
export function DashboardWidgets() {
  return (
    <div className="grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-4">
      {/* First row: spans 2 columns on large screens */}
      <div className="lg:col-span-2">
        <AiClientInsights />
      </div>
      <div>
        <DailyInspirationCard />
      </div>
      
      {/* Second row */}
      <div>
        <TherapistCheckIn />
      </div>
      <div>
        <UpcomingAppointments />
      </div>
      <div>
        <KeyMetrics />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```
4. Ensure the grid is responsive and adapts well to different screen sizes
5. Consider adding gap spacing between widgets for better visual separation

# Test Strategy:
1. Test the responsive behavior of the grid layout across different viewport sizes
2. Verify that the widgets are arranged correctly in both mobile and desktop views
3. Check that the grid maintains proper spacing and alignment
4. Ensure all widget components are properly imported and rendered
