# Task ID: 316
# Title: Epic 6: Build the 'AI Inbox' UI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 315
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a dedicated view for the user to see which tasks are currently assigned to the AI.
# Details:
This provides necessary visibility into the AI's workload, building user trust.

# Test Strategy:
Delegate two tasks to the AI. Navigate to the 'AI Inbox'. Both tasks should be listed. Go back to your personal inbox and delegate a third task. Return to the 'AI Inbox' and verify the list updates to show all three tasks.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create `task.listForAI` Procedure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a new tRPC procedure to fetch tasks assigned to the AI.
### Details:
In `taskRouter`, create a new procedure `listForAI`. This query will be similar to `list` but will have a hardcoded `WHERE` clause to fetch tasks where `owner_id` matches the AI Worker's UUID. This is for the user to view the AI's queue.

## 2. Create 'AI Inbox' Page [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build a new page or view that displays the AI's task list.
### Details:
This could be a new page at `/tasks/ai-inbox` or a special filter in the sidebar. This view will call the `api.task.listForAI.useQuery()` hook and render the results, perhaps with a slightly different UI to indicate they are 'in progress' by the AI.
