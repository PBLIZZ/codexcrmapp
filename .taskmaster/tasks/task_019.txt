# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up performance measurement and monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement tools and metrics to measure application performance and establish baselines
### Details:
Install and configure performance monitoring tools like Lighthouse, Web Vitals, and New Relic. Create a dashboard to track key metrics including First Contentful Paint, Time to Interactive, and API response times. Document current performance baselines across different pages and user flows to measure improvements against.

## 2. Implement code splitting and React.memo optimizations [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1
### Description: Reduce bundle size and prevent unnecessary re-renders with code splitting and memoization
### Details:
Use dynamic imports for route-based code splitting. Implement React.lazy and Suspense for component-level code splitting. Apply React.memo to expensive components that render frequently but with the same props. Create custom comparison functions for complex props. Measure bundle size reduction and render performance improvements.

## 3. Optimize database queries and add indexes [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1
### Description: Improve database performance by optimizing queries and adding appropriate indexes
### Details:
Profile existing database queries to identify slow performers. Add indexes to frequently queried fields. Optimize JOIN operations and implement pagination where appropriate. Consider denormalizing data for read-heavy operations. Update ORM configurations to optimize query generation. Document query performance improvements.

## 4. Set up caching strategies [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1, 19.3
### Description: Implement various caching mechanisms to reduce redundant computations and network requests
### Details:
Implement Redis for server-side caching of expensive database queries and API responses. Set up browser caching with appropriate cache headers. Implement React Query or SWR for client-side data caching. Configure CDN caching for static assets. Create cache invalidation strategies to ensure data freshness.

## 5. Implement virtualized lists for large datasets [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1, 19.2
### Description: Use virtualization techniques to efficiently render large lists and tables
### Details:
Integrate react-window or react-virtualized for efficiently rendering large lists. Implement infinite scrolling with virtualization for paginated data. Create custom virtualized components for complex UI elements like tables with variable row heights. Measure and document memory usage and render performance improvements.

## 6. Optimize images with Next.js Image component [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1
### Description: Improve image loading performance using Next.js Image optimization features
### Details:
Replace standard img tags with Next.js Image components. Configure appropriate sizes, quality settings, and loading priorities. Implement responsive images with different sizes for different viewports. Set up proper placeholder and blur-up techniques. Optimize WebP and AVIF format delivery where supported. Measure and document image loading performance improvements.

## 7. Add prefetching and debouncing techniques [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1, 19.2, 19.4
### Description: Implement prefetching for anticipated user actions and debounce frequent events
### Details:
Implement Next.js link prefetching for anticipated navigation paths. Set up data prefetching for likely user interactions. Add debouncing for search inputs and other frequent user events. Implement throttling for scroll and resize event handlers. Create intelligent preloading strategies based on user behavior patterns. Measure and document improvements in perceived performance.
