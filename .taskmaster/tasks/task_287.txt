# Task ID: 287
# Title: Validate App Router Compliance for Next.js 15 Standards
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 285
# Priority: medium
# Description: Analyze app router files for compliance with Next.js 15 structural conventions focusing on authentication flow and main section routing optimization.
# Details:
Scan `app/*/page.tsx` and `app/*/layout.tsx` files with special attention to protected/unprotected page routing: dashboard (protected), login/signup (unprotected with auth redirects), and the 8 main sections with nested routing (contacts/groups, messages/email, settings/billing, etc.). Use a custom script or linter to verify each directory contains a page.tsx and optionally layout.tsx following Next.js 15 patterns. Ensure proper auth redirects, loading states for protected pages, and optimal routing for sidebar navigation efficiency. Output a JSON report with directory compliance status and deviations.

# Test Strategy:
Verify the JSON report indicates 100% compliance with special validation for auth flow and section routing patterns. Manually check protected page samples to confirm script accuracy.
