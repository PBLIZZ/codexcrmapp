# Task ID: 309
# Title: Epic 4: Implement Task-to-Contact Assignment Backend
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 301, 302
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the backend tRPC procedures for assigning tasks to contacts.
# Details:
This involves creating mutations to manage the records in the `task_assignees` join table.

# Test Strategy:
Use an API client to call `task.addAssignee` with a task ID and a contact ID. Query the `task_assignees` table in Supabase to verify the new record was created. Then call `task.removeAssignee` and verify the record was deleted.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement `task.addAssignee` Mutation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a tRPC mutation to add a record to the `task_assignees` table.
### Details:
In `taskRouter`, create an `addAssignee` mutation that takes `{ taskId: string, contactId: string }` and inserts a new record into the join table.

## 2. Implement `task.removeAssignee` Mutation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a tRPC mutation to remove a record from the `task_assignees` table.
### Details:
In `taskRouter`, create a `removeAssignee` mutation that takes `{ taskId: string, contactId: string }` and deletes the corresponding record from the join table.
