# Task ID: 309
# Title: Epic 4: Implement Task-to-Contact Assignment Backend
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 301, 302
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the backend tRPC procedures for assigning tasks to contacts.
# Details:
This involves creating mutations to manage the records in the `task_assignees` join table.

# Test Strategy:
Use an API client to call `task.addAssignee` with a task ID and a contact ID. Query the `task_assignees` table in Supabase to verify the new record was created. Then call `task.removeAssignee` and verify the record was deleted.
