# Task ID: 230
# Title: AI Background Processing System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 222, 223, 220
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement background AI processing for contact enrichment and automated insights
# Details:
Create background processing system with: 1) Queue system using Supabase Edge Functions or Vercel background functions 2) Contact enrichment pipeline using external APIs (Clearbit, FullContact) 3) AI-powered note analysis and tagging 4) Relationship insight generation 5) Email draft assistance 6) Automated task suggestions based on contact interactions. Implement proper error handling, retry logic, and monitoring with logging.
