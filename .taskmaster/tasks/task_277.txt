# Task ID: 277
# Title: Finalize sidebar.tsx for Floating Style
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 276
# Priority: high
# Description: Modify the sidebar.tsx component to give the sidebar rounded corners, making it appear to float.
# Details:
1. Open `apps/web/components/ui/sidebar.tsx`
2. Locate the `<div data-sidebar="sidebar" ...>` element within the Sidebar component
3. Add `rounded-lg` or `rounded-xl` to its class list to round the corners
4. Consider adding a subtle shadow effect (e.g., `shadow-md`) to enhance the floating appearance
5. Ensure the rounded corners are consistent with the design language of the application
6. Verify that the modifications don't break any existing sidebar functionality

# Test Strategy:
1. Visually inspect the sidebar to confirm the rounded corners are applied correctly
2. Test the sidebar in both expanded and collapsed states to ensure the floating style is maintained
3. Verify that the sidebar still functions correctly after the style changes
4. Check the appearance in different browsers to ensure consistent rendering
