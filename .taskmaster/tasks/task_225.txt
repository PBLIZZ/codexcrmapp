# Task ID: 225
# Title: Dashboard Module Implementation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 223, 224, 214
# Priority: high
# Description: Build the main dashboard serving as practitioner's 'second brain' with business metrics and AI task delegation
# Details:
Implement dashboard with: 1) Business health visualization cards using Chart.js or Recharts 2) Upcoming sessions widget with calendar integration preview 3) Retention risk indicators with color-coded alerts 4) AI task delegation panel with approval workflow 5) Goal progress tracking components 6) Quick action buttons for common tasks. Use React Query for data fetching and caching. Implement real-time updates using Supabase realtime subscriptions.

# Test Strategy:
Component testing with mock data, integration testing with tRPC endpoints, performance testing for real-time updates, and user acceptance testing for workflow efficiency

# Subtasks:
## 1. Metrics Visualization Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement interactive charts, graphs, and visual components for displaying key performance metrics and analytics data
### Details:
Create reusable chart components using libraries like Chart.js or D3.js, implement responsive design for different screen sizes, add interactive features like tooltips and drill-down capabilities, and ensure proper data formatting for visualization

## 2. Real-time Data Integration [done]
### Dependencies: 225.1
### Description: Establish WebSocket connections and implement real-time data streaming to keep dashboard metrics updated automatically
