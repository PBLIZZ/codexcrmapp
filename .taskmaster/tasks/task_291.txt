# Task ID: 291
# Title: Score Module Impact and Estimate Refactoring Effort
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 288, 290
# Priority: medium
# Description: Assign impact scores and estimate refactoring effort per module with application value prioritization.
# Details:
Use dead code report (Task 288) and risk assessment (Task 290). Map each module to an impact score using a standardized matrix weighted for application value: authentication flow reliability, navigation responsiveness, main section performance, toast notification system efficiency, and protected page loading speed. Estimate refactoring effort (hours) based on lines of code, interdependency density, and business logic complexity. Prioritize core user journey components and the 8 main sections. Output a Markdown report with module, impact score, effort, application section, and priority.

# Test Strategy:
Validate each module has an impact score and effort estimate with application justification. Check that estimates are numerically defined, reasonable, and aligned with user journey priorities.
