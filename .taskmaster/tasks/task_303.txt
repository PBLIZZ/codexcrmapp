# Task ID: 303
# Title: Epic 2: Build Core Task UI - Display
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 302
# Priority: high
# Description: Build the main UI for the Tasks module, focusing on displaying tasks in a 'Things-inspired' list view.
# Details:
Refactor the existing files in `app/tasks/` to create a clean layout. The main page component will use the `task.list` tRPC hook to fetch data and pass it to a `ThingsTaskCard` component for rendering each task. This task focuses purely on displaying data.

# Test Strategy:
Navigate to the `/tasks` route in your browser. Verify that the list of mock tasks from your tRPC endpoint is being displayed correctly, with each task rendered as a distinct `ThingsTaskCard`.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Refactor `app/tasks/page.tsx` [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Clean up the main tasks page to orchestrate the data fetching and rendering.
### Details:
The component should use the `api.task.list.useQuery()` hook from tRPC. It should handle loading and error states gracefully. On success, it should map over the returned data and render a `ThingsTaskCard` for each task.

## 2. Build `ThingsTaskCard` Component [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a reusable component to display a single task's information.
### Details:
Create `ThingsTaskCard.tsx`. It will receive a `task` object as a prop. For this task, it only needs to display the `task.title` and a checkbox. The checkbox should not have any functionality yet.
