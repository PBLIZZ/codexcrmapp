# Task ID: 303
# Title: Epic 2: Build Core Task UI - Display
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 302
# Priority: high
# Description: Build the main UI for the Tasks module, focusing on displaying tasks in a 'Things-inspired' list view.
# Details:
Refactor the existing files in `app/tasks/` to create a clean layout. The main page component will use the `task.list` tRPC hook to fetch data and pass it to a `ThingsTaskCard` component for rendering each task. This task focuses purely on displaying data.

# Test Strategy:
Navigate to the `/tasks` route in your browser. Verify that the list of mock tasks from your tRPC endpoint is being displayed correctly, with each task rendered as a distinct `ThingsTaskCard`.
