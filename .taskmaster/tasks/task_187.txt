# Task ID: 187
# Title: Comprehensive Testing and Bug Fixing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 182, 183, 184, 185, 186
# Priority: high
# Description: Perform thorough testing of the entire application to ensure all functionality related to the renamed 'contacts' entity works correctly, and fix any issues discovered.
# Details:
1. Create a comprehensive test plan covering all features that interact with the renamed entity:
   - Login and logout functionality
   - Photo uploads for contacts
   - Creating new contacts
   - Using the "quick contact" feature
   - Creating new groups
   - Using the "quick group" feature
   - All tRPC routes that were modified

2. Test database operations:
   - Verify that all CRUD operations work with the new table name
   - Test any complex queries or joins that involve the contacts table
   - Verify that RLS policies are working correctly

3. Test frontend functionality:
   - Navigate through all pages that previously dealt with clients
   - Test all forms and interactive elements
   - Verify that data is displayed correctly
   - Test error handling and edge cases

4. Look for common issues:
   - Missed references to 'client' in code or UI
   - Type errors or runtime errors
   - Broken links or navigation
   - Issues with data fetching or mutations

5. Fix any bugs discovered during testing:
   - Document each issue found
   - Implement fixes
   - Verify that fixes don't introduce new problems

6. Regression testing:
   - Ensure that unrelated functionality still works correctly
   - Verify that performance hasn't been negatively impacted

Be methodical and thorough in testing. Use both automated tests and manual testing to ensure complete coverage.

# Test Strategy:
1. Execute all existing automated tests (unit, integration, e2e)
2. Perform manual testing following the test plan
3. Test all acceptance criteria listed in the PRD
4. Use browser developer tools to check for console errors
5. Test with different user roles if applicable
6. Verify database integrity after operations
7. Test performance to ensure the changes haven't introduced any slowdowns
8. Document all issues found and their resolutions
9. Create a final test report summarizing the testing process and results
