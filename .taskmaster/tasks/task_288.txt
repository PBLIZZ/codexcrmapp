# Task ID: 288
# Title: Identify and Report Dead Code in the Monorepo
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Run ESLint to detect unused variables and functions with focus on deprecated features and unused business logic across the 8 main sections.
# Details:
Execute `npx eslint **/*.tsx --rule 'no-unused-vars: error'` to capture dead code warnings. Parse the ESLint output into a JSON report with file paths, line numbers, and dead code segments. Special focus on identifying unused utility functions, deprecated authentication methods, obsolete sidebar components, unused dashboard widgets, and deprecated notification/toast implementations. Categorize dead code by application section and business impact.
