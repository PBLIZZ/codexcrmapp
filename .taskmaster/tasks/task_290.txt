# Task ID: 290
# Title: Perform Risk Assessment on Code Modules Based on Audit Findings
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 286, 289
# Priority: medium
# Description: Compute risk scores for modules based on naming violations and performance impact with application continuity focus.
# Details:
Use the Markdown naming violations report (Task 286) and JSON performance baseline (Task 289). Run static analysis for code complexity with special attention to authentication flow logic, sidebar navigation components, protected page routing, and core user journey components. Combine data to calculate a risk score (1-10) per module based on violation density, performance impact, and application criticality. Prioritize modules handling authentication, navigation (AppSidebarController), main layout rendering, and the 8 main section entry points. Output a JSON risk assessment report with business continuity categorization.

# Test Strategy:
Confirm each module has a risk score with application context. Validate that scores correlate with violation density, performance impact, and user journey criticality.

# Subtasks:
