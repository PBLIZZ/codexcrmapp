# Subtasks:
## 1. Conduct Accessibility Audit [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Perform a comprehensive accessibility audit of all existing components against WCAG 2.1 AA standards
### Details:
Use automated tools (like axe, WAVE) and manual testing to identify accessibility issues. Document all findings in a spreadsheet with severity levels, affected components, and recommended fixes. Test with actual assistive technologies like screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver) to identify real-world issues.

## 2. Implement ARIA Attributes and Roles [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1
### Description: Add appropriate ARIA attributes and roles to all interactive components
### Details:
Based on audit findings, implement aria-label, aria-labelledby, aria-describedby, aria-expanded, aria-controls, and other relevant attributes. Ensure proper role attributes for custom components. Create documentation for developers on ARIA usage patterns.

## 3. Enhance Keyboard Navigation [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1
### Description: Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible with logical tab order
### Details:
Implement focus management for modals and custom widgets. Ensure all interactive elements can be activated with keyboard (Enter/Space). Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions with proper documentation. Test tab order flows logically through the application.

## 4. Optimize Visual Accessibility [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1
### Description: Improve color contrast, focus indicators, and text readability throughout the application
### Details:
Update color palette to ensure all text meets WCAG AA contrast ratio (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text). Implement visible focus indicators that don't rely solely on color. Ensure text can be resized up to 200% without loss of content or functionality.

## 5. Implement Screen Reader Support [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.2, 18.3
### Description: Add screen reader announcements for dynamic content and implement skip links
### Details:
Add aria-live regions for important updates and notifications. Implement skip links to bypass repetitive navigation. Ensure all images have appropriate alt text. Test with multiple screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver) to verify proper announcements.

## 6. Create Accessible Forms [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.2, 18.4
### Description: Ensure all forms have proper labels, instructions, and error handling
### Details:
Associate labels with form controls using 'for' attribute or nesting. Provide clear instructions for complex inputs. Implement accessible error messages that are announced to screen readers. Ensure form validation errors are clearly indicated visually and programmatically.
