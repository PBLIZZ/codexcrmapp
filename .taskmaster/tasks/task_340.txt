# Task ID: 340
# Title: Comprehensive Build Process Validation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 339
# Priority: high
# Description: Perform a comprehensive test of all build processes across the monorepo to ensure they complete successfully after all dependency changes.
# Details:
Run `pnpm build` at the root level, or individually run `pnpm build` in each workspace package. Monitor the output for any errors, warnings, or failures. Address any issues that arise, which might indicate lingering dependency problems or misconfigurations. This step validates the success of all previous dependency cleanup and centralization efforts.

# Test Strategy:
Confirm that all build commands complete with exit code 0. Check build logs for any critical errors. Verify that generated build artifacts are correct and functional.
