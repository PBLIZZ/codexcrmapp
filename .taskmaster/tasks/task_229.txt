# Task ID: 229
# Title: AI Assistant Chat Interface
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 223, 224, 217
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop global AI chat interface with natural language command processing
# Details:
Build AI assistant with: 1) Persistent chat bubble using floating UI components 2) Chat interface with message history and typing indicators 3) Natural language processing integration with OpenAI GPT-4 or Claude 4) Command suggestion chips for common actions 5) tRPC procedure mapping for CRM actions 6) Approval workflow for critical operations 7) Message persistence and conversation threading. Use WebSocket or Server-Sent Events for real-time communication.
