# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Error Tracking and Alerting [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up a system to track application errors and send alerts when critical issues occur.
### Details:
Select and integrate an error tracking service (like Sentry, Rollbar, or LogRocket). Configure error grouping, notification thresholds, and alert channels (email, Slack, etc.). Implement client-side and server-side error capturing. Set up proper context collection for errors while ensuring no sensitive data is captured.

## 2. Set Up Performance Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1
### Description: Implement monitoring for application performance metrics including load times, API response times, and resource usage.
### Details:
Select and integrate a performance monitoring tool (like New Relic, Datadog, or Prometheus). Configure frontend performance tracking (page load times, client-side rendering metrics). Set up backend performance monitoring (API response times, database query performance). Establish performance baselines and configure alerts for degradations.

## 3. Configure Uptime Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1
### Description: Establish monitoring for application availability and implement alerts for downtime events.
### Details:
Select and set up an uptime monitoring service (like Pingdom, UptimeRobot, or StatusCake). Configure health check endpoints for different application components. Set up monitoring for critical API endpoints and services. Implement escalation procedures for downtime incidents. Configure status page for transparent communication during outages.

## 4. Implement User Analytics with Privacy Considerations [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.2
### Description: Set up analytics to track user behavior while ensuring compliance with privacy regulations.
### Details:
Select a privacy-focused analytics platform (like Plausible, Fathom, or a configured Google Analytics). Implement data anonymization techniques. Create a clear privacy policy regarding data collection. Set up consent management for regions with strict privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA). Configure event tracking for key user interactions while minimizing personal data collection.

## 5. Create Monitoring Dashboards [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1, 24.2, 24.3, 24.4
### Description: Develop comprehensive dashboards to visualize key metrics from all monitoring systems.
### Details:
Design and implement dashboards for different stakeholders (developers, product managers, executives). Integrate data from all monitoring systems into unified views. Create visualizations for error rates, performance metrics, uptime statistics, and user analytics. Set up automated reporting for regular status updates. Implement dashboard access controls based on team roles.
