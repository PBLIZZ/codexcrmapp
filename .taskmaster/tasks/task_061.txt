# Task ID: 61
# Title: Epic 5: System Quality & Operations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 53
# Priority: high
# Description: Focusing on non-functional requirements like error handling, performance, security, deployment, automated testing, and analytics/monitoring. Incorporates original tasks 16, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24.
# Details:
This epic covers the critical non-functional aspects of the system that ensure reliability, security, and maintainability. It includes implementing robust error handling mechanisms, optimizing performance, establishing security protocols, setting up deployment pipelines, creating automated testing frameworks, and implementing analytics and monitoring solutions.

# Test Strategy:
Each component will require specific testing approaches:
- Error handling: Test with simulated errors and edge cases
- Performance: Load testing and benchmarking
- Security: Penetration testing and security audits
- Deployment: Verify CI/CD pipelines with test deployments
- Automated testing: Meta-testing of test frameworks
- Analytics/Monitoring: Verify data collection accuracy and alert systems

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define System Quality Metrics [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify and define key performance indicators and quality metrics for the system
### Details:
Create a comprehensive list of system quality metrics including performance benchmarks, reliability targets, security standards, and user experience measures. Document baseline expectations and target thresholds for each metric.

## 2. Implement Monitoring Infrastructure [pending]
### Dependencies: 61.1
### Description: Set up monitoring tools and infrastructure to track system quality metrics
### Details:
Select and implement appropriate monitoring tools to track the defined metrics. Configure dashboards, alerts, and reporting mechanisms. Ensure monitoring covers all critical system components and integration points.

## 3. Establish Operational Procedures [pending]
### Dependencies: 61.1, 61.2
### Description: Create standard operating procedures for system maintenance and incident response
### Details:
Develop documentation for routine maintenance tasks, backup procedures, and incident response protocols. Include escalation paths, on-call rotations, and recovery procedures. Create runbooks for common operational scenarios and troubleshooting guides.
