# Task ID: 339
# Title: Optimize Development Server Memory Usage
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 338
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement strategies to reduce the development server's memory consumption from 2GB+ to under 1GB.
# Details:
This task is a culmination of previous dependency cleanup efforts. Strategies include: ensuring proper hoisting of dependencies by pnpm, verifying no circular dependencies, optimizing webpack/rollup configurations for development builds (e.g., disabling unnecessary source maps or optimizations during dev), and potentially using tools like `heapdump` or Node.js's built-in profiler to identify memory leaks if issues persist. Focus on the `apps/web` package as it's likely the primary consumer.

# Test Strategy:
Start the development server and monitor its memory usage using system tools (e.g., `htop`, Task Manager, or `process.memoryUsage()` in Node.js). Confirm that memory consumption remains consistently below 1GB during active development.
