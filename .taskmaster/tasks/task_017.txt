# Task ID: 17
# Title: Feature: Manual Data Import/Export (CSV/JSON)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 34
# Priority: low
# Description: Create functionality for manually importing contacts from CSV/JSON files and exporting contacts. (Derived from original Task 17, focusing on manual aspects. Details include file parsing, mapping, validation, duplicate handling, progress indicators, error handling for malformed files, batch processing, export format selection.)

# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement File Upload and Parsing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a file upload component that accepts CSV and JSON files and parses their contents into a usable data structure.
### Details:
Develop a drag-and-drop interface with file type validation. Implement parsers for both CSV and JSON formats that can handle large files efficiently. Include basic error detection for completely invalid files.

## 2. Create Data Mapping and Validation Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1
### Description: Develop a system to map imported data fields to application data models and validate data integrity.
### Details:
Build a UI for users to map columns/fields from imported files to system fields. Implement validation rules for each field type (dates, emails, numbers, etc.). Create a preview mechanism to show users how their data will be imported.

## 3. Build Duplicate Detection and Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.2
### Description: Implement logic to identify potential duplicates in imported data and provide resolution options.
### Details:
Create algorithms to detect duplicates based on key fields. Develop UI components to show potential duplicates and offer options (skip, replace, merge). Implement batch handling of duplicate resolution choices.

## 4. Develop Progress Indicators for Batch Operations [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1
### Description: Create visual feedback mechanisms to show import/export progress for large datasets.
### Details:
Implement a progress bar component that updates in real-time. Add status messages for different stages of processing. Create a cancellation mechanism for long-running operations.

## 5. Implement Error Handling for Malformed Files [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1, 17.2
### Description: Develop robust error handling for partially malformed files with detailed user feedback.
### Details:
Create line-by-line validation with specific error messages. Implement a UI to display problematic records with highlighting of issues. Add options to skip problematic records or cancel the entire import.

## 6. Create Export Functionality with Format Selection [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.2
### Description: Implement data export capabilities with options for different file formats and data filtering.
### Details:
Build export UI with format selection (CSV, JSON, Excel). Implement data filtering options to allow partial exports. Add configuration options for field inclusion/exclusion and header customization. Include progress indicators for large exports.
