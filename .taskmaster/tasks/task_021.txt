# Task ID: 21
# Title: Feature: Implement Security Measures
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 61, 4, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Comprehensive security measures. Details: CSP, XSS/CSRF protection, secure cookies, rate limiting, input sanitization, HTTP security headers, secure API key handling, CORS, secure auth flows, security auditing. (Corresponds to original Task 21)
# Details:


# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up Content Security Policy (CSP) [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a robust Content Security Policy to restrict which resources can be loaded by the application
### Details:
Define CSP headers to control allowed sources for scripts, styles, images, and other resources. Test the policy in report-only mode before full enforcement. Document all allowed sources and exceptions.

## 2. Implement XSS and CSRF Protection [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.1
### Description: Add protection mechanisms against Cross-Site Scripting and Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks
### Details:
Implement CSRF tokens for all state-changing operations. Add input validation and output encoding to prevent XSS. Configure framework-specific protections and test with security tools.

## 3. Configure Secure Cookies and Session Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.2
### Description: Set up secure cookie handling and robust session management practices
### Details:
Configure cookies with Secure, HttpOnly, and SameSite attributes. Implement session timeout, rotation, and validation. Ensure proper session destruction on logout and secure session storage.

## 4. Add Rate Limiting for Sensitive Endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.3
### Description: Implement rate limiting to protect sensitive operations from abuse
### Details:
Identify all sensitive endpoints (login, registration, password reset). Implement appropriate rate limiting strategies based on IP, user, or request patterns. Add proper response headers and error handling for rate-limited requests.

## 5. Implement Input Sanitization Throughout the Application [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.2
### Description: Add comprehensive input validation and sanitization across all user inputs
### Details:
Create validation rules for all user inputs. Implement server-side validation regardless of client-side checks. Use parameterized queries for database operations. Sanitize outputs based on context (HTML, JSON, etc).

## 6. Configure HTTP Security Headers [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.1
### Description: Set up additional HTTP security headers to enhance application security
### Details:
Implement headers such as X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy, and Strict-Transport-Security. Test header configuration and document the purpose of each header.

## 7. Set up Secure API Key Handling and CORS Policies [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.3, 21.6
### Description: Implement secure handling of API keys and configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing policies
### Details:
Create a secure storage mechanism for API keys. Implement proper CORS headers to restrict cross-origin access. Document allowed origins and methods. Set up API key rotation and revocation procedures.
