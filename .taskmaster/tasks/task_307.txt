# Task ID: 307
# Title: Epic 3: Implement Project-Based Task Filtering
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 306
# Priority: high
# Description: Enable users to view tasks filtered by the selected project.
# Details:
This task makes the project list in the sidebar functional, allowing it to control the main task view.

# Test Strategy:
Create two projects, 'Project A' and 'Project B'. Create 'Task 1' assigned to 'Project A' and 'Task 2' assigned to 'Project B'. Click 'Project A' in the sidebar; only 'Task 1' should be visible. Click 'Project B'; only 'Task 2' should be visible. Click 'Inbox' or 'All Tasks'; both should be visible.
