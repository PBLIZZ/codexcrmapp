# Task ID: 341
# Title: Preserve Existing Functionality
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 340
# Priority: high
# Description: Validate that all existing functionality across the CodexCRM application is preserved after dependency cleanup and updates.
# Details:
Conduct thorough manual and automated testing of key application features. This includes user authentication, data fetching, CRUD operations, UI interactions, and any critical business logic. Leverage existing unit and integration tests. If automated tests are insufficient, perform a detailed regression test plan. Pay close attention to areas affected by tRPC and Supabase updates.

# Test Strategy:
Execute the full suite of unit and integration tests. Perform manual end-to-end testing of critical user flows. Verify data integrity and API responses. Ensure no regressions are introduced.
