# Task ID: 216
# Title: Develop Task Management System with Drag-and-Drop Functionality
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 212, 213, 228
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a drag-and-drop task organization system with AI-suggested tasks categorized by business area, including task prioritization based on business impact.
# Details:
Create a comprehensive task management system with the following features:

1. Task board with column layout (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done)
2. Drag-and-drop functionality for task organization
3. Task cards with priority indicators and category labels
4. Category filters for business areas (marketing, client follow-up, etc.)
5. AI suggestion interface for task generation
6. Task prioritization based on business impact

Implementation details:
- Use react-beautiful-dnd or @dnd-kit/core for drag-and-drop functionality
- Implement optimistic UI updates for drag operations
- Use tRPC procedures for task CRUD operations
- Create a task suggestion algorithm based on business metrics
- Implement task categorization system with color coding
- Use React Context for managing task board state

Example task board implementation:
```tsx
// components/tasks/TaskBoard.tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { DragDropContext, Droppable, Draggable } from 'react-beautiful-dnd';
import { TaskCard } from '@/components/tasks/TaskCard';
import { trpc } from '@/lib/trpc';

export function TaskBoard() {
  const [columns, setColumns] = useState({
    'todo': { id: 'todo', title: 'To Do', taskIds: [] },
    'in-progress': { id: 'in-progress', title: 'In Progress', taskIds: [] },
    'done': { id: 'done', title: 'Done', taskIds: [] },
  });
  
  const { data: tasks, isLoading } = trpc.tasks.list.useQuery();
  const updateTaskMutation = trpc.tasks.update.useMutation();
  
  // Initialize columns with tasks from the server
  useEffect(() => {
    if (tasks) {
      // Map tasks to columns
    }
  }, [tasks]);
  
  const onDragEnd = (result) => {
    const { destination, source, draggableId } = result;
    
    if (!destination) return;
    if (
      destination.droppableId === source.droppableId &&
      destination.index === source.index
    ) return;
    
    // Update columns state
    const startColumn = columns[source.droppableId];
    const endColumn = columns[destination.droppableId];
    
    if (startColumn === endColumn) {
      // Reordering within the same column
    } else {
      // Moving between columns
    }
    
    // Update task status in the database
    updateTaskMutation.mutate({
      id: draggableId,
      status: destination.droppableId,
    });
  };
  
  // Render board UI with DragDropContext, Droppable, and Draggable components
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for task state management logic
2. Integration tests for task CRUD operations
3. Component tests for drag-and-drop functionality using simulated drag events
4. End-to-end tests for complete task workflows
5. Performance testing with large numbers of tasks
6. Accessibility testing for keyboard navigation of task board
7. Visual regression tests for task cards and board layout
8. User acceptance testing to validate task organization workflow

# Subtasks:
## 1. Task Board Layout [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the overall layout structure for the task board including columns, headers, and responsive grid system
### Details:
Create the foundational layout components including board container, column containers, column headers, and ensure responsive design across different screen sizes. Implement CSS Grid or Flexbox for proper alignment and spacing.

## 2. Task Card Components [done]
### Dependencies: 216.1
### Description: Develop reusable task card components with proper styling, content display, and interaction states
### Details:
Build task card components that display task information, handle hover states, selection states, and provide visual feedback. Include task title, description, assignee, priority indicators, and action buttons.

## 3. State Management [done]
### Dependencies: 216.2
### Description: Implement centralized state management for task data, board state, and user interactions
### Details:
Set up state management system (Redux, Zustand, or Context API) to handle task data, board columns, drag states, loading states, and error handling. Implement actions and reducers for task operations.

## 4. Drag-and-Drop Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: 216.3
### Description: Integrate drag-and-drop functionality using libraries like react-beautiful-dnd or dnd-kit for task movement
### Details:
Implement drag-and-drop functionality allowing users to move tasks between columns and reorder within columns. Handle drag start, drag over, and drop events with proper visual feedback and animations.

## 5. Backend Synchronization with Optimistic Updates [done]
### Dependencies: 216.4
### Description: Implement real-time synchronization with backend API including optimistic updates and conflict resolution
### Details:
Set up API integration for task operations with optimistic updates for immediate UI feedback. Implement WebSocket or polling for real-time updates, error handling, rollback mechanisms, and conflict resolution for concurrent edits.
