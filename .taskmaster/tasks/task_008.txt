# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Database Schema for Contact Groups [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the database schema to support contact groups and the many-to-many relationship between contacts and groups
### Details:
Design and implement the following tables: 1) 'group' table with fields for id, name, description, and creation date, 2) 'contact_group' junction table to establish the many-to-many relationship between contacts and groups with appropriate foreign keys and constraints. Update the Prisma schema accordingly and create the necessary migration.

## 2. Implement tRPC Procedures for Group CRUD Operations [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Create tRPC procedures to handle the creation, reading, updating, and deletion of contact groups
### Details:
Implement the following tRPC procedures: createGroup, getGroups, getGroupById, updateGroup, and deleteGroup. Include proper validation using Zod schemas and ensure appropriate error handling. Update the router configuration to expose these endpoints.

## 3. Implement tRPC Procedures for Contact-Group Associations [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2
### Description: Create tRPC procedures to manage the associations between contacts and groups
### Details:
Implement tRPC procedures for: addContactToGroup, removeContactFromGroup, getContactsByGroup, and getGroupsByContact. These procedures should handle the many-to-many relationship operations and include proper validation and error handling.

## 4. Create UI Components for Group Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2, 8.3
### Description: Develop UI components for creating, viewing, editing, and deleting groups, as well as managing group memberships
### Details:
Create the following components: GroupList, GroupForm (for create/edit), GroupDetail view, and a GroupMembershipManager component that allows adding/removing contacts from groups. Implement proper state management and form validation. Ensure responsive design and accessibility compliance.

## 5. Implement Filtering and Display of Contacts by Group [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3, 8.4
### Description: Add functionality to filter and display contacts based on group membership
### Details:
Enhance the contact list view to include group filtering options. Implement a dropdown or tag-based filter UI that allows users to select one or multiple groups and display only contacts belonging to those groups. Add visual indicators (tags/badges) to show group membership on contact cards/rows. Update the contact detail view to display and manage the groups a contact belongs to.

## 6. Fix Group Filtering in ContactSidebar [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Fix issue where clicking on groups in the contact sidebar does not properly filter the contacts list. The UI elements are visually clickable but do not trigger the filtering functionality as expected.
### Details:
Investigate and fix the ContactSidebar component where group links are not properly filtering contacts when clicked. The issue appears to be that while the group cards on the main Groups page correctly filter contacts when clicked, the same functionality is not working from the sidebar. Implement proper click handlers and router navigation to ensure consistent filtering behavior across the application. Ensure proper styling of active state for selected group filters.
