# Task ID: 306
# Title: Epic 3: Implement Project Creation Flow
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 302
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build the complete user flow for creating a new Project.
# Details:
This mirrors the task creation flow but for the 'Projects' entity. It involves the UI form and the backend tRPC mutation.

# Test Strategy:
In the `TasksSidebar`, use the 'New Project' UI. Create a project named 'Q4 Marketing Campaign'. Verify it immediately appears in the project list in the sidebar and persists after a page refresh.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement `project.create` tRPC Mutation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Flesh out the `project.create` procedure to save a new project to the database.
### Details:
The mutation will take `{ name: string }` and create a new record in the `projects` table for the current user.

## 2. Build 'New Project' Form [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a UI form, likely in a modal or a dedicated view, for creating projects.
### Details:
The form will have an input for the project name and a submit button. On submit, it will call the `api.project.create.useMutation()` hook and refetch the project list on success.
