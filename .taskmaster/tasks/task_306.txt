# Task ID: 306
# Title: Epic 3: Implement Project Creation Flow
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 302
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build the complete user flow for creating a new Project.
# Details:
This mirrors the task creation flow but for the 'Projects' entity. It involves the UI form and the backend tRPC mutation.

# Test Strategy:
In the `TasksSidebar`, use the 'New Project' UI. Create a project named 'Q4 Marketing Campaign'. Verify it immediately appears in the project list in the sidebar and persists after a page refresh.
