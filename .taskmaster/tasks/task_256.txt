# Task ID: 256
# Title: Create Dedicated MobileMenu Component
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Extract the mobile Sheet-based navigation logic from the existing Navbar.tsx into a new MobileMenu.tsx component.
# Details:
1. Create a new file at apps/web/components/layout/MobileMenu.tsx
2. Extract the following from Navbar.tsx:
   - The Sheet component and its related SheetTrigger and SheetContent
   - All JSX related to the mobile slide-out panel
   - The logo and navigation links for mobile view
3. Move the mainNavItems constant into this file
4. Implement the component structure

# Test Strategy:
1. Render the MobileMenu component in isolation using React Testing Library
2. Verify the Sheet, SheetTrigger, and SheetContent components are properly rendered
3. Test that clicking the menu button opens the sheet
4. Verify all navigation items from mainNavItems are correctly displayed
5. Test that navigation links have the correct href attributes
6. Ensure the component is only visible on mobile viewports using responsive testing
