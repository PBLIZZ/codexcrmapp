# Task ID: 191
# Title: Rename Sign In to Log In throughout the application
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Update all instances of 'Sign In' (and variations) to 'Log In' throughout the codebase, including page titles, component names, button texts, and links.
# Details:
1. Create a search pattern to find all instances of 'Sign In', 'SignIn', 'signin' in the codebase
2. Update the following files and components:
   - Page titles
   - Component names (e.g., SignInForm to LogInForm)
   - Button texts
   - Navigation links
   - Route paths (consider changing '/sign-in' to '/log-in')
3. Ensure consistent casing (e.g., 'Log In' for display text, 'login' for variables/routes)
4. Update any related documentation or comments
5. Verify that functionality remains intact after renaming

# Test Strategy:
1. Create a checklist of all instances that need to be renamed
2. Manually verify each instance has been updated
3. Test navigation flows to ensure all links work correctly
4. Verify that authentication functionality still works properly
5. Check for any broken references or imports after renaming components
