# Description: Redesign the Log In page (formerly Sign In) with new styling, layout, and UX improvements according to the PRD requirements.
# Details:
1. Update the page at `apps/web/app/(auth)/sign-in/page.tsx` (or create new page at `/log-in` if route path is changing)
2. Implement new layout with:
   - Company logo at the top (from `public/images/logo.png`)
   - Title: "Log In" or "Log in to CodexCRM"
   - Form elements within a Shadcn Card component
   - Email and Password input fields with placeholder labels
   - "Log In" button styled with `bg-teal-800 text-teal-200`
   - "Forgot Password?" link
   - "Continue with Google" button
   - Magic Link option (if retained)
   - Link to Sign Up page
   - Terms acceptance text
3. Apply styling theme:
   - Page background: `bg-teal-50`
   - Text color: `text-teal-800`
   - Accent color: `text-orange-500`
4. Implement UX best practices:
   - Autofocus on first input field
   - Inline validation
   - Clear error messages
   - Password visibility toggle

# Test Strategy:
1. Visual inspection against design requirements
2. Test form submission with valid and invalid inputs
3. Verify error handling and validation messages
4. Test navigation to Sign Up page and Forgot Password
5. Test OAuth (Google) login flow
6. Test Magic Link functionality if implemented
7. Verify responsive design on mobile, tablet, and desktop
8. Test accessibility with keyboard navigation and screen readers
