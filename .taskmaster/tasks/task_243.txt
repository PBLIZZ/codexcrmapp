# Task ID: 243
# Title: Refactor Codebase to Use Relative Paths for Monorepo Structure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 184, 210
# Priority: medium
# Description: Refactor the codebase to change absolute filepaths to relative paths to better align with the monorepo structure, improving maintainability and reducing import errors.
# Details:
This task involves systematically updating file imports throughout the codebase to use relative paths instead of absolute paths, ensuring compatibility with the monorepo architecture:

1. Identify all files using absolute paths:
   - Scan the entire codebase for import statements using absolute paths (e.g., imports starting with '@/' or '/' or referencing packages by name)
   - Focus on key directories: apps/web, packages/server, and shared libraries

2. Establish consistent path resolution rules:
   - For imports within the same package/app: Use relative paths (e.g., `import { Component } from '../components/Component'`)
   - For imports across packages: Use package references defined in tsconfig paths (e.g., `import { type } from '@myapp/shared'`)

3. Update import statements:
   - Replace absolute paths with relative paths
   - Example:
     ```typescript
     // Before
     import { ContactForm } from '@/components/contacts/ContactForm';
     
     // After
     import { ContactForm } from '../../components/contacts/ContactForm';
     ```

4. Update tsconfig.json files:
   - Ensure path aliases are correctly configured in all tsconfig.json files
   - Verify baseUrl and paths settings are consistent across packages

5. Update build configurations:
   - Ensure webpack, vite, or other bundler configurations properly resolve the relative paths
   - Update any path-related plugins or settings

6. Special considerations:
   - Handle dynamic imports correctly
   - Ensure test files maintain correct imports
   - Update any path utilities or helper functions that construct file paths

7. Documentation:
   - Update documentation to reflect the new path resolution strategy
   - Create guidelines for future development to maintain consistency

# Test Strategy:
1. Static Analysis:
   - Run ESLint with import/no-absolute-path rule enabled to verify no absolute paths remain
   - Use TypeScript compiler to check for any type errors resulting from path changes

2. Build Verification:
   - Run the build process for all packages to ensure no build errors
   - Verify that all imports are correctly resolved during build time

3. Runtime Testing:
   - Start the application and navigate through major features
   - Verify that all components load correctly without console errors related to imports

4. Cross-Package Testing:
   - Test functionality that relies on imports between different packages
   - Verify that shared components and utilities are correctly imported and function as expected

5. CI/CD Pipeline:
   - Ensure CI/CD pipeline successfully builds and tests the application
   - Verify that deployment processes work correctly with the updated path structure

6. Code Review:
   - Have team members review the changes to ensure consistency
   - Verify that the established path conventions are followed throughout

7. Documentation Testing:
   - Verify that any path examples in documentation are updated
   - Test that developer onboarding processes work with the new path structure
