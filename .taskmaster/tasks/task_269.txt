# Task ID: 269
# Title: Setup React 19 Component Architecture with Naming Standards
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 267, 268
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create React component architecture following PascalCase naming and proper hook conventions
# Details:
Create components directory with PascalCase naming: components/UserProfile/UserProfileCard.tsx, components/Dashboard/DashboardLayout.tsx. Implement custom hooks with 'use' prefix: hooks/useAuth.ts, hooks/useFormValidation.ts. Follow React 19 patterns including new use() hook for data fetching, improved Suspense boundaries, and server components. Create component templates with proper prop naming (camelCase), event handlers (handleXxx), and state management (useState with setXxx). Use React.forwardRef and React.memo where appropriate.

# Test Strategy:
Test component rendering and prop passing. Verify custom hooks work correctly with React DevTools. Test server and client components separately. Ensure proper TypeScript integration with component props.
