# Task ID: 310
# Title: Epic 4: Implement Task-to-Contact Assignment Frontend
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 309
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build the UI for users to assign contacts to a task.
# Details:
This involves creating a search-and-select component within the task detail view.

# Test Strategy:
Open a task that has no assignees. Assign 'John Doe' and 'Jane Smith'. Save and reopen; both should be listed. Then, remove 'Jane Smith'. Save and reopen; only 'John Doe' should be listed.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Build Contact Search Component [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a reusable component with a search input that displays matching contacts.
### Details:
This component will use the `api.contact.search.useQuery` hook. As the user types, it should call the hook with the query and display the results in a list. Clicking a result should trigger a selection callback.

## 2. Integrate Component into Task Detail View [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Place the contact search component into the task detail UI and manage the state of assigned contacts.
### Details:
The task detail UI will fetch current assignees. The search component will be used to add new assignees (`task.addAssignee`). A UI element (e.g., a list of names with 'x' buttons) will be used to display current assignees and allow their removal (`task.removeAssignee`).
