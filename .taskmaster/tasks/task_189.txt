# Task ID: 189
# Title: Navbar logout still produces TRPCClientError: UNAUTHORIZED
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 211
# Priority: high
# Description: This issue is now being addressed as part of the comprehensive logout functionality improvements in task #211. The original error (TRPCClientError: UNAUTHORIZED from navbar logout) will be resolved through centralized logout handling implementation.
# Details:
Superseded by task #211 'Fix, Centralize, and Standardize Logout Functionality'. The root cause investigation and solution will be implemented as part of the new standardized approach to logout flows across all application components.

# Test Strategy:
Testing will be handled under task #211's validation strategy covering all logout entry points including navbar, account page, and session timeout scenarios.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Investigate and document TRPCClientError: UNAUTHORIZED root cause [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Analyze the current navbar logout implementation to identify why it produces TRPCClientError: UNAUTHORIZED. Document the error flow, authentication state management issues, and timing problems that cause the unauthorized error.
### Details:
Review the navbar logout component code, examine tRPC client configuration, analyze Supabase session handling during logout, and document the sequence of events that leads to the UNAUTHORIZED error. Create a technical analysis document with findings and recommendations.

## 2. Design centralized logout service architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: 189.1
### Description: Design a centralized logout service that will be implemented in task #211 to handle all logout scenarios consistently across the application, preventing UNAUTHORIZED errors.
### Details:
Create architectural design for centralized logout service using Next.js App Router patterns, define interfaces for logout handling, specify Supabase session cleanup procedures, and design error handling strategies. Include path aliasing requirements using @/ imports.

## 3. Implement logout state management improvements [pending]
### Dependencies: 189.2
### Description: Implement improved state management for logout operations to prevent race conditions and unauthorized errors during the logout process.
### Details:
Create logout state management using React state or context, implement proper loading states during logout, add error boundary handling for logout operations, and ensure proper cleanup of authentication state before API calls.

## 4. Update navbar logout implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 189.3
### Description: Refactor the navbar logout component to use the new centralized logout approach and eliminate the TRPCClientError: UNAUTHORIZED issue.
### Details:
Update navbar component to use centralized logout service, implement proper error handling, add loading states for logout process, ensure proper session cleanup before navigation, and follow project path aliasing with @/ imports.

## 5. Validate fix and close original issue [pending]
### Dependencies: 189.4
### Description: Perform comprehensive testing to ensure the TRPCClientError: UNAUTHORIZED issue is resolved and the navbar logout works correctly as part of the centralized logout implementation.
### Details:
Execute end-to-end testing of navbar logout functionality, verify integration with task #211 centralized logout system, test edge cases and error scenarios, and confirm the original UNAUTHORIZED error no longer occurs.
