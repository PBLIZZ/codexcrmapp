# Task ID: 258
# Title: Implement Floating OmniBot UI (OmniBotFloat.tsx)
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a new component OmniBotFloat.tsx that provides a floating action button (FAB) to trigger the AI assistant sidebar.
# Details:
1. Create a new file at apps/web/components/layout/OmniBotFloat.tsx
2. Implement a floating action button fixed to the bottom-right of the viewport
3. Use Sheet components to create a floating panel that appears when the FAB is clicked
4. Style the panel to appear as a floating element rather than a full-height sidebar
5. Import and render the existing OmniBot component inside the panel

# Test Strategy:
1. Render the OmniBotFloat component in isolation
2. Verify the floating action button is positioned correctly at the bottom-right
3. Test that clicking the FAB opens the sheet panel
4. Ensure the panel is styled correctly with margins, rounded corners, and proper dimensions
5. Verify the OmniBot component is properly rendered inside the panel
6. Test that the panel can be closed
7. Verify the z-index ensures the component appears above other page elements
