## Code Style and Conventions

This project uses ESLint for linting and Prettier for code formatting. The specific rules are defined in the `packages/config/eslint` and `packages/config/prettier` packages, respectively. TypeScript is used with strict type checking, and path aliases are configured in `tsconfig.json` for cleaner imports.
