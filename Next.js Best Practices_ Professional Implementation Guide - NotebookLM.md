## Next.js AppRouter: Contacts with TanStack Query

You're looking to create a robust and well-organized Next.js application using the App Router, with a specific focus on a contacts section that incorporates both server-side rendering and client-side interactivity, leveraging TanStack Query for data management.

Here's how your dynamic content and application structure would likely look, drawing on the best practices outlined in the sources:

### I. Overall Project Structure and Route Grouping

Your project would start with the standard app/ directory, which is where Next.js handles App Router code [1]. To organize your sections without affecting the URL path, you would use a route group, for instance, (main)/ [2, 3].

This (main) folder would contain your core application sections, including contacts/.

The directory structure would begin as:

app/ [1]

(main)/ [2, 3]

layout.tsx (This could be a root layout for the (main) group, or you could have multiple root layouts by placing them within each route group if your sections have completely different UIs [4, 5]).

contacts/ [2]

page.tsx (The main entry point for the contacts section) [5, 6].

II. Co-locating Files within the contacts Section

Next.js is unopinionated about how you organize and co-locate project files [7].

You can store application code (like components, lib, utils, and hooks) directly inside route segments within the app directory [8].

This is a recommended strategy as it allows you to split more specific application code into the route segments that use them [9].

For your contacts section, this means you can have a structure like:

app/(main)/contacts/

page.tsx
layout.tsx (for the contacts section itself, if needed, nested within (main)/layout.tsx [10])
components/ (e.g., Sidebar.tsx, FloatingChat.tsx, Widgets.tsx, Toolbar.tsx, ContactTable.tsx, SidebarInset.tsx, MainNavigation.tsx) [1, 8, 11]
lib/ (utilities specific to contacts) [1, 8, 11]
utils/ (general utilities for contacts) [1, 8, 11]
hooks/ (custom hooks for contacts logic, e.g., useContactFilter) [1, 8, 11]
[contactId]/ (for individual contact pages, a dynamic route segment) [2, 10, 12]

page.tsx
layout.tsx (the nested layout for a specific contact)

Good to know: Files co-located in these folders (e.g., app/(main)/contacts/components/) will not be publicly routable unless they are page.tsx or route.ts files [8, 11].

### III. app/(main)/contacts/page.tsx (Server Component)

This page.tsx file for your main contacts view would be a Server Component by default [13, 14]. It would be responsible for initial data fetching and orchestrating the main layout of the contacts section.

Inside app/(main)/contacts/page.tsx:

It would implicitly or explicitly leverage the layout.tsx in app/(main)/ and potentially app/(main)/contacts/ [10].

It would import your Sidebar component and FloatingChat interface. Both of these can be Server Components if their logic is primarily for rendering static UI or fetching data close to the source [15, 16].

If FloatingChat requires client-side interactivity (e.g., state, event handlers), it would need the "use client" directive [15, 17].

### IV. Sidebar and Nested Layouts for Dynamic Content

The Sidebar component itself could be a Server Component. Within the Sidebar, the sidebar inset can also be a Server Component.

However, the inset contains:

Main Navigation: If your main navigation involves client-side state or even handlers (e.g., active link highlighting, dropdown menus), it would need to be a Client Component ("use client") [15, 17].

Nested Layout for the Contact Page: This refers to the layout for dynamic contact details, residing at app/(main)/contacts/[contactId]/layout.tsx. This nested layout will also be a Server Component by default [10, 14].

Interleaving Server and Client Components: You can pass Server Components as children or props to Client Components [18]. This means your client-side MainNavigation component could receive links or other UI elements that are themselves Server Components.

The structure for the dynamic contact page would be:

app/(main)/contacts/[contactId]/

layout.tsx (This is your nested layout for individual contact pages) [10]
page.tsx (The actual content of an individual contact page)

### V. Components within the Nested Layout (app/(main)/contacts/[contactId]/layout.tsx)

This nested layout.tsx (a Server Component) would import your widgets, toolbar, and TanStack Query table.

Toolbar: As it's described as "static," the Toolbar component can remain a Server Component [15, 16].

Widgets: Since the widgets will be "interactive," they must be Client Components ("use client") [15, 17]. They would handle their own state and event listeners.

TanStack Query Table: The table, being interactive and using TanStack Query, must be a Client Component ("use client") [19, 20]. The useQuery and useMutation hooks are designed to run in the client environment [19-21].

### VI. TanStack Query for Server-Side Loading and Client-Side Interactivity

The emphasis on server-side loading being inherent in this layout perfectly aligns with TanStack Query's capabilities in the Next.js App Router [19, 22, 23].

Here's how it integrates:

Provider Setup: First, you need a Client Component (e.g., app/providers.tsx or app/(main)/providers.tsx) to register your QueryClientProvider [19, 21].

This Providers component would be imported and wrap your children in your root app/layout.tsx or app/(main)/layout.tsx [20, 21]. This ensures the queryClient is available throughout your application for all client components.

Server-Side Prefetching: For the ContactTable (or any data-intensive component), data can be prefetched directly within your Server Components (e.g., app/(main)/contacts/page.tsx or a component rendered by it) [22, 23].

You would create a singleton QueryClient instance (often using React's cache function to ensure it's scoped per request and doesn't leak sensitive data between users) [21, 24, 25].

Then, use queryClient.prefetchQuery to fetch the necessary data for your table [21, 24].

The state of this queryClient is then dehydrated (dehydrate(queryClient)) and passed to a HydrationBoundary component, which wraps your Client Component (e.g., ContactTable) [21, 24, 26].

Client-Side Hydration and Interaction: When your ContactTable (a Client Component) renders, its useQuery hook will instantly load the prefetched data from the server via HydrationBoundary [21, 24].

If the data becomes stale, TanStack Query will automatically refetch it in the background [22, 27].

This provides an "instant feel" as the data is already available [24, 28].

Complex Client-Side Needs: For features like pagination, infinite scrolling, optimistic updates (for editing contacts), or smart refetching (e.g., when the window regains focus), TanStack Query is ideal [29-35]. Native Next.js fetch and Server Components are sufficient for read-only data, but TanStack Query excels in scenarios requiring complex data management and client-side interactivity [31, 33, 36, 37].

By combining Next.js Server Components for initial rendering and data fetching close to the source with Client Components for interactivity and TanStack Query for advanced data management, you achieve a highly performant, scalable, and maintainable application.
