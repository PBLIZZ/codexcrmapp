# Prisma + Supabase Setup: Technical Handover Document

**Project**: CodeX CRM Monorepo  
**Date**: January 21, 2025  
**Status**: ⚠️ Partial Success - App Running, CLI Tools Blocked  

## Executive Summary

We successfully configured Prisma in your CodeX CRM monorepo to work with remote Supabase, resolving the original "Module not found" error. Your **Next.js application is now running and can connect to the database**. However, Prisma CLI tools (like `db:pull`, `db:studio`) are blocked by IPv6 connectivity issues.

## Project Architecture

- **Monorepo Structure**: Turbo + pnpm workspaces
- **Database Package**: `packages/db/` (shared across apps)
- **Database**: Remote Supabase PostgreSQL (free plan)
- **Prisma Version**: 6.11.1
- **Connection Method**: IPv4-compatible pooler (port 6543)

## Steps Taken

1. **Prisma and Packages Configuration**
   - **Updated package.json scripts** to ensure compatibility with Supabase free plan.
   - **Fixed model imports and types** to adapt to changes in newer Prisma versions.

2. **Prisma Schema Setup**
   - **Corrected datasource block** to remove `directUrl` and rely solely on the `DATABASE_URL` with an IPv4-compatible pooler.

3. **Environment Configuration**
   - **Ensured environment variables** in the root `.env` and `packages/db/.env` were correctly set to use the pooler on port 6543.
   - Confirmed correct passwords and supabase project reference.

4. **Prisma Client and Studio**
   - Correctly generated the Prisma client using the remote Supabase configuration.
   - Attempted to use Prisma Studio, but due to the IPv6 issue, this could not connect.

## Challenges Encountered

1. **IPv6 Connectivity**
   - The local environment could not connect to Supabase's direct URLs due to lack of IPv6 support.
   - The pooler `DATABASE_URL` was adjusted to exclusively use port 6543 for IPv4 support.

2. **Prisma CLI**
   - Commands like `prisma db pull` failed due to IPv6 issues.
   - Network-level blockage prevented some command execution.

## Current Status

- **Prisma Client**: Generated successfully and imports work within your Next.js application.
- **Application**: Your Next.js app runs without import errors.
- **IPv6**: Connection problem persists. Prism CLI commands are affected.

## Next Steps

1. **IPv6 Provision**: Obtain IPv6 support to resolve CLI connectivity issues.
2. **ONGOING MONITORING**: Regularly check the application setup to ensure that changes in Supabase or Prisma updates don’t disrupt working configurations.
3. **Possible Alternatives**: Consider using a proxy or VPN service that provides IPv6 tunneling to complete CLI tasks.
