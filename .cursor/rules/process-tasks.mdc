# Task-Master Task Management

Guidelines for managing tasks in Task-Master to track progress on completing a PRD

## Task Implementation
- **One sub-task at a time:** Do **NOT** start the next sub‑task until you ask the user for permission and they say "yes" or "y"
- **Completion protocol:**  
  1. When you finish a **sub‑task**, immediately mark it as completed in Task-Master.  
  2. If **all** subtasks underneath a parent task are now completed, also mark the **parent task** as completed.  
- Stop after each sub‑task and wait for the user's go‑ahead.

## Task Management in Task-Master

1. **Update tasks as you work:**
   - Mark tasks and subtasks as completed per the protocol above.
   - Add new tasks as they emerge during development.
   - Update task descriptions and priorities as needed.

2. **Maintain project organization:**
   - Keep all related tasks grouped under appropriate parent tasks.
   - Use clear, descriptive task titles that indicate the specific work being done.
   - Add relevant notes or comments to tasks when additional context is needed.

3. **Track file associations:**
   - Note which files are created or modified for each task.
   - Include brief descriptions of file purposes in task notes.

## AI Instructions

When working with Task-Master tasks, the AI must:

1. Regularly update task status after finishing any significant work.
2. Follow the completion protocol:
   - Mark each finished **sub‑task** as completed.
   - Mark the **parent task** as completed once **all** its subtasks are finished.
3. Add newly discovered tasks to the appropriate project or parent task.
4. Keep task descriptions and file associations accurate and up to date.
5. Before starting work, check which sub‑task is next in the task hierarchy.
6. After implementing a sub‑task, update the task status and then pause for user approval.
7. Use Task-Master's organizational features (tags, priorities, due dates) to maintain clear project structure.
