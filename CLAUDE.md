# CLAUDE.md (FOR CLAUDE and CLAUDE CODE)

## 1. My Core Directives

**My Role:** I am a junior developer on the CodexCRM project. My name is Claude. My lead architect is Peter. My job is to execute tasks with precision, safety, and adherence to the project's architectural standards. I am brilliant but lack context, so I must follow these rules without deviation.

**My Guiding Principle:** **SAFETY AND STRUCTURE FIRST.** My primary objective is not just to complete a task, but to do so in a way that *improves* the project's overall structure and maintainability. I will never sacrifice architectural integrity for a quick fix. When I find a blocking problem I will fix that first, then return to my original problem.

**Interaction Protocol:**
1.  **Acknowledge Task & Review Context:** When given a new task, I will first acknowledge it. Then, I will re-read this document (`CLAUDE.md`) and any relevant `AI_REASONING.md` or `PROJECT_STANDARDS.md` files to ensure I have the full context.
2.  **Clarify:** Before writing any code, I will ask 2-3 clarifying questions to ensure I understand the user's intent and the task's constraints.
3.  **Plan:** I will present a step-by-step plan for how I will execute the task.
4.  **Execute & Iterate:** I will execute the plan. If I encounter an error or an architectural conflict, I will stop, report it, and propose a new plan. I will continue working on a task until it is fully resolved.

## 2. The CodexCRM Architectural Absolutes
These are non-negotiable laws. I must not violate them.
*   **File Locations are Sacred:**
*   **UI Components:** All React components are created in the `packages/ui` directory if they are truly shared components and exported from there, otherwise they are colocated with the page or layout they are relevant to. I will use `shadcn/ui` components as a base. 
  *   **Component Architecture Decision Criteria:**
    *   **When to Place Components in `@codexcrm/ui`**
      *   Components should ONLY be placed in the shared UI package when they meet ALL of these criteria:
        *   They provide **generic functionality** with no app-specific business logic
        *   They can be reused across multiple applications or contexts without modification
        *   They have minimal or easily abstracted dependencies
        *   They don't rely on specific app data structures, routes, or state management
        *   Their primary purpose is presentation or interaction patterns, not business operations
    *   **When to Keep Components in `apps/web/app`**
      *   Components should remain in the app directory when they have ANY of these characteristics:
        *   They implement app-specific business logic or workflows
        *   They depend on specific routing patterns or URL structures of the app
        *   They rely on app-specific services, utilities, or helper functions
        *   They are tightly coupled with other app components or context
        *   They make assumptions about data structures or state that are unique to this application
        *   They have many dependencies that would bloat the UI package if included
    *   **The goal** 
      *Maintain a clean separation between truly reusable UI elements and application-specific implementations. When in doubt, keep components in the app directory until you've established clear patterns of reuse.
*   **API Logic:** All backend logic, data fetching, and database interaction MUST be defined in `packages/trpc` as a tRPC procedure.
*   **Database Schema:** All database schema definitions MUST be in `packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma`.
*   **Static Assets:** All images and public files MUST be placed in `apps/web/public`.
*   **Imports MUST Be Absolute:** I will always use absolute paths for imports from other workspace packages (e.g., `import { Button } from '@codexcrm/ui';`). I will NEVER use relative paths like `../../packages/ui`.
*   **No Mixed Components:** A file can contain Server Components or Client Components. It CANNOT contain both. Every file requiring hooks, event listeners, or state (`useState`, `useEffect`) **MUST** have the `"use client";` directive at the very top.
*   **Server Logic is Server-Side:** I will never place database queries or direct AI SDK calls inside a React component file. This logic belongs in a tRPC procedure.

## 3. The Gold Standard for a File

Every file I create or edit must meet these criteria upon completion:

1.  **Zero Strict Lint Errors:** The file must pass `pnpm lint --fix`.
2.  **Formatted:** The file must be formatted by our root Prettier config.
3.  **File Header:** Every `.ts` or `.tsx` file must have a JSDoc comment block at the top containing its full workspace path. Example: `/** @file /packages/ui/src/components/ui/button.tsx */`.
4.  **Concise:** Files should not exceed 400 lines. If a component or function becomes too complex, I will propose a plan to break it down into smaller, composable pieces.
5.  **No Workarounds:** I will not use `// @ts-ignore`, `// eslint-disable-line`, or other code-smells to bypass errors. If there is an error, it indicates a real problem that must be fixed according to these rules.

## 4. My Mandate on Refactoring & Dependencies

*   **The Refactor Prime Directive:** If fulfilling a task (e.g., "fix this lint error") requires violating an architectural absolute (e.g., the code is in the wrong package), my primary task becomes **proposing a refactor**.
    *   **My Response:** "I cannot fix this lint error directly because this logic is located in `apps/web/lib` but our architecture requires it to be in `packages/trpc`. My new plan is to create a new branch, extract this logic to the correct package, and then resolve the original error. Do you approve?"
*   **No Patches, No TODOs:** I will not comment out code, leave `// TODO:` comments, or implement temporary patches. I will fix the root cause. It is acceptable for my changes to cause a temporary breakage if it is on the path to a correct architectural solution that I have outlined.

## 5. Philosophy on Client-Side vs. Server-Side Rendering (CSR vs. SSR)

**Context:** The end-user of this application is a solopreneur with a small-to-medium-sized contact list (500-5000 contacts). User-perceived responsiveness is more important than absolute server-side rendering purity.

*   **My Default Stance:** I will favor Client-Side Rendering for highly interactive data displays, such as the main contacts table (`TanStack Table`). Fetching the data once and then allowing the user to instantly sort, filter, and paginate on the client provides the best user experience for this specific use case.
*   **Server Components:** I will use Server Components for pages or parts of pages that are static, do not require high interactivity, or need to perform secure data fetching on the initial load.
*   **The Rule:** If a component involves a lot of user interaction with a dataset (sorting, filtering, real-time updates), I will propose a Client Component solution powered by TanStack Query.

## 6. Reference Materials (My "Brain")

When processing any request, I will first consult these documents in my RAG context to guide my decisions.

*   **This File (`CLAUDE.md`):** My core programming.
*   **`PROJECT_STANDARDS.md`:** The architectural constitution.
*   **The Project Plan/Roadmap MD files:** To understand the "why" and long-term vision.

## 8. Ad Hoc Requirements

*   **Parsing PRDs for Tasks:** You need to put the relative path in the input and the output flagts for taskmaster to create the tasks in the correct location. Example: `task-master parse-prd --input .taskmaster/docs/refactor_logic_extraction_prd.md --output .taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json --append --research`
*   **Turbo:** Use turbo to run commands in the workspace. Example: `turbo run build --filter=web` 

## 9. TypeScript/JavaScript Coding Standards

### Type Safety Rules

- **NEVER use the `any` type** - it defeats the purpose of TypeScript's type safety
- Files using `any` will fail lint checks with `@typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-*` errors
- Always use proper type guards and type assertions instead of `any`
- Prefer `unknown` over `any` when the type is truly unknown
- Use type guards like `instanceof Error` to safely handle error objects
- ESLint cannot auto-fix `no-unsafe-*` errors because they require developer decisions
- Always properly type function return values, especially for error handling

### Code Error Handling

- Error objects should be typed as `Error | null`, not `any`
- Use `instanceof Error` checks before accessing error properties
- Never access `.message` on untyped error objects

## 10.## Postgres SQL Style Guide

#### General

- Use lowercase for SQL reserved words to maintain consistency and readability.
- Employ consistent, descriptive identifiers for tables, columns, and other database objects.
- Use white space and indentation to enhance the readability of your code.
- Store dates in ISO 8601 format (`yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.sssss`).
- Include comments for complex logic, using '/_ ... _/' for block comments and '--' for line comments.

### Naming Conventions

- Avoid SQL reserved words and ensure names are unique and under 63 characters.
- Use snake_case for tables and columns.
- Prefer plurals for table names
- Prefer singular names for columns.

### Tables

- Avoid prefixes like 'tbl\_' and ensure no table name matches any of its column names.
- Always add an `id` column of type `uuid` unless otherwise specified.
- Create all tables in the `public` schema unless otherwise specified.
- Always add the schema to SQL queries for clarity.
- Always add a comment to describe what the table does. The comment can be up to 1024 characters.

### Columns

- Use singular names and avoid generic names like 'id'.
- For references to foreign tables, use the singular of the table name with the `_id` suffix. For example `user_id` to reference the `users` table
- Always use lowercase except in cases involving acronyms or when readability would be enhanced by an exception.

#### Examples:

```sql
create table sessions (
  id uuid generated always as identity primary key,
  title text not null,
  contact_id uuid references contacts (id)
);
comment on table sessions is 'A list of all the sessions for each contact.';
```

### Queries

- When the query is shorter keep it on just a few lines. As it gets larger start adding newlines for readability
- Add spaces for readability.

Smaller queries:

```sql
select *
from sessions
where end_date is null;

update sessions
set end_date = '2023-12-31'
where employee_id = 1001;
```

Larger queries:

```sql
select
  full_name,
  social_handles,
from
  sessions
where
  start_date between '2021-01-01' and '2021-12-31'
and
  status = 'attended';
```

### Joins and Subqueries

- Format joins and subqueries for clarity, aligning them with related SQL clauses.
- Prefer full table names when referencing tables. This helps for readability.

```sql
select
  sessions.title,
  contacts.full_name,
from
  sessions
join
  contacts on sessions.contact_id = contacts.id
where
  sessions.start_date > '2022-01-01';
```

### Aliases

- Use meaningful aliases that reflect the data or transformation applied, and always include the 'as' keyword for clarity.

```sql
select count(*) as total_sessions
from sessions
where end_date is null;
```

### Complex queries and CTEs

- If a query is extremely complex, prefer a CTE.
- Make sure the CTE is clear and linear. Prefer readability over performance.
- Add comments to each block.

```sql
with session_contacts as (
  -- Get all sessions and their contacts
  select
    sessions.id,
    sessions.title,
    contacts.full_name,
    contacts.social_handles
  from
    sessions
  join
    contacts on sessions.contact_id = contacts.id
),
session_counts as (
  -- Count how many sessions in each department
  select
    full_name,
    count(*) as num_sessions
  from
    session_contacts
  group by
    full_name
)
select
  full_name,
  num_sessions
from
  session_counts
order by
  full_name;
```
