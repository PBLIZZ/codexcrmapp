| **Contacts** | 4.0/4 | 47 issues | 15 files | ðŸ”´ CRITICAL |
| **Auth** | 2.4/4 | 10 issues | 5 files | ðŸŸ  MEDIUM |
| **Other** | 11.7/4 | 117 issues | 15 files | ðŸŸ  MEDIUM |

**Recommendation**: Implement systematic dead code cleanup, starting with contacts module.

### Performance Risk Assessment
**Critical Performance Issues**: 2 modules require immediate optimization

| Module | Performance Score | Primary Issue | Bundle Impact |
|--------|------------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Dashboard** | 3.0/3 | 429 kB home page | First impression critical |
| **Contacts** | 3.0/3 | 22.9 kB component + 395 kB routes | User productivity impact |
| **Auth** | 2.0/3 | 268-290 kB auth flow | Onboarding experience |
