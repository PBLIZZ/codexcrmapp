# Task ID: 368
# Title: Audit Server Actions Directory
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 359
# Priority: medium
# Description: Identify all Server Actions that use old Supabase patterns
# Details:
1. Search in `apps/web/actions` directory for all `.ts` files
2. Look for files that:
   - Have `'use server'` directive
   - Import from `@/lib/supabase/server` or similar
   - Use `createServerSupabaseClient()` or similar
   - Have `supabase.from('table_name')` calls
3. Create a list of all such files with their current patterns
4. Do not modify any code, only document findings

# Test Strategy:
1. Provide a complete list of affected Server Action files
2. Show the specific patterns that need to be changed
3. Confirm no Server Actions were missed
