# 🛠️ Implementation Plan: Modernize Auth & App Structure

## Phase 1: Audit & Quote
- Extract key practices from docs
- Map them to existing code structure

## Phase 2: Planning
- Define migration sequence (middleware → API → layouts → client auth)
- Account for Supabase + tRPC + TanStack interaction

## Phase 3: Execution
- Refactor in stages
- Document breakages and resolution steps in scratchpad

## Phase 4: Testing & Cleanup
- Run integration tests
- Remove deprecated patterns
- Final code audit
