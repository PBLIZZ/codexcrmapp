# Task ID: 367
# Title: Refactor Contact Delete Client Component
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 364
# Priority: high
# Description: Replace old fetch patterns with tRPC mutations in contact delete component
# Details:
1. Find the contact delete component or delete handler (likely in `apps/web/components` or similar)
2. Add import: `import { trpc } from '@/lib/trpc/client';`
3. Replace any `fetch('/api/contacts/[id]', { method: 'DELETE', ... })` with `trpc.contact.delete.useMutation()`
4. Update delete handler to use `mutation.mutate({ id })` instead of fetch
5. Remove any direct fetch calls
6. Keep all UI logic and confirmation dialogs unchanged
7. Do not modify any other files

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify tRPC client is imported
2. Check that delete mutations are used instead of fetch
3. Confirm delete functionality works with new pattern
