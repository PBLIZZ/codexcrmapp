## 📋 Next Developer Action Plan (UPDATED)

### **Immediate Next Steps (Day 1) - Build Tools Completion**

1. **Task 349 - Rimraf Centralization**
   - Audit for remaining rimraf installations in individual packages
   - Remove duplicates and ensure all clean scripts work with root rimraf
   - Expected effort: 30 minutes

2. **Task 350 - Final ESLint Cleanup** 
   - Double-check for any missed ESLint duplicates
   - Verify all linting works with centralized configuration
   - Expected effort: 15 minutes

3. **Task 341 - Validation Testing**
   - Run comprehensive build tests across all packages
   - Test web app functionality with new auth architecture
   - Verify no regressions introduced by peer dependency changes
   - Expected effort: 45 minutes

### **Week 1 Goals - Configuration Finalization**
- Complete Tasks 352-355 (configuration centralization)
- Validate all build processes are working optimally
- Document any new architectural patterns established

### **Testing Strategy (UPDATED)**
```bash
# Memory validation (should stay ~100MB)
pnpm run dev --filter=@codexcrm/web &
ps aux | grep "next dev" | awk '{print $6/1024 " MB"}'

# Build validation (all should pass)
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm turbo build --filter="@codexcrm/auth"
pnpm turbo build --filter="@codexcrm/ui"

# Architecture validation
# - Auth package should build without Next.js
# - UI package should have no React duplicates in bundle
# - Web app should access auth via local server module
```

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes & Warnings (UPDATED)

### **NEW - Architectural Changes**
- **Auth Import Path Changed:** `@codexcrm/auth/server` → `@/lib/auth/server` (in web app)
- **API Context Signature:** Now requires `supabaseUser` parameter in createContext
- **UI Package:** Uses peer dependencies - ensure host app provides React/Next.js

### **Established Architectural Rules (ENFORCE THESE)**
From CLAUDE.md:
- ✅ **Auth package must remain framework-agnostic** (no framework dependencies)
- ✅ **UI components go in packages/ui ONLY if truly shared and generic**
- ✅ **App-specific components stay in apps/web/app**
- ✅ **No database queries in React components** (use tRPC)
- ✅ **All imports between packages must be absolute** (@codexcrm/ui)

### **Known Issues (DON'T FIX THESE)**
- Web app has many TypeScript errors (app-specific, not dependency related)
- Missing sidebar components exports in UI package
- These are application-level issues, NOT dependency problems

### **Memory Monitoring (CRITICAL)**
- Development server should stay under 200MB
- If memory usage spikes above 500MB, investigate dependency duplication
- Current baseline: ~92MB (excellent)

## 🗂️ **Repository State (UPDATED & ACCURATE)**

### Package Structure
```
codexcrm-monorepo/
├── Root: Centralized dev deps (TypeScript, ESLint, tsup, rimraf)
├── packages/
│   ├── auth/: 🌟 100% Framework-Agnostic
│   ├── config/:
│   │   ├── eslint/
│   │   └── tsup/  <-- NEW: Centralized tsup config package
│   └── ui/: Optimized peer dependencies
```

### **NEW - Build Scripts**
*   The `build` script in `ui`, `trpc`, and `config` now uses the robust two-step pattern:
    `"build": "tsup && tsc --emitDeclarationOnly"`

### Dependencies Status (UPDATED & ACCURATE)
*   ✅ **tsup:** Centralized into `@codexcrm/config-tsup` with a reliable build process.
*   ✅ **rimraf:** Centralized at the root. No mixed versions.
*   ✅ **ESLint:** Centralized via `@codexcrm/config-eslint`. Zero duplicates.
*   ✅ **Peer Dependencies:** React, React-DOM, Next.js optimally configured.

---

## 📋 **Next Developer Action Plan (UPDATED)**

### **Immediate Next Steps (Day 1) - Configuration Completion**

1.  **Task 353 - PostCSS Centralization**
    *   Find any `postcss.config.js` files.
    *   If duplication exists, create a shared config (e.g., in `packages/config/postcss`).
    *   Update packages to use the centralized config and validate builds.

2.  **Task 354 - Tailwind Centralization**
    *   Find any `tailwind.config.js` files.
    *   Create a base `tailwind.preset.js` in a shared config package.
    *   Update app/package `tailwind.config.js` files to use the shared preset.

3.  **Task 341 - Comprehensive Validation**
    *   Run `pnpm turbo build` across the entire monorepo.
    *   Run `pnpm run dev` and perform a smoke test of the web app's main features (login, viewing data, etc.) to ensure no regressions.

---

## ⚠️ **Important Notes & Warnings (UPDATED)**

### **NEW - Critical Build Process Information**
*   **The two-step `tsup && tsc` build process is intentional and critical.** It was implemented to solve a persistent build failure. **DO NOT** attempt to merge them back into a single `tsup` command with `dts: true`, as this will re-introduce the build failure.

### **Established Architectural Rules (ENFORCE THESE)**
*   ✅ **Auth package must remain framework-agnostic.**
*   ✅ **No database queries in React components** (use tRPC).

### **Known Issues (DON'T FIX THESE)**
*   The web app has many pre-existing TypeScript errors. These are out of scope.

---

## 🛠️ **Tools & Commands (UPDATED)**

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build the entire monorepo (the ultimate validation)
pnpm turbo build

# Run type-checking only (faster)
pnpm run typecheck

# Run the web app for manual testing
pnpm run dev --filter=@codexcrm/web
```
