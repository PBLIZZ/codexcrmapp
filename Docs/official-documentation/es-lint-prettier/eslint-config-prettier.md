# eslint-config-prettier

Turns off all rules that are unnecessary or might conflict with Prettier.

This lets you use your favorite shareable config without letting its stylistic choices get in the way when using Prettier.

Note that this config only turns rules off, so it only makes sense using it together with some other config.

## Installation

Install eslint-config-prettier:

```bash
npm i -D eslint-config-prettier
yarn add -D eslint-config-prettier
pnpm add -D eslint-config-prettier
bun add -D eslint-config-prettier
```

Add eslint-config-prettier to your ESLint configuration ‚Äì either to eslintrc or to eslint.config.js (flat config).

### eslintrc

Add "prettier" to the "extends" array in your `.eslintrc.*` file. Make sure to put it last, so it gets the chance to override other configs.

```json
{
  "extends": [
    "some-other-config-you-use",
    "prettier"
  ]
}
```

### eslint.config.js (flat config)

Import eslint-config-prettier, and put it in the configuration array ‚Äì after other configs that you want to override.

```js
import someConfig from "some-other-config-you-use";
// Note the `/flat` suffix here, the difference from default entry is that
// `/flat` added `name` property to the exported object to improve
// [config-inspector](https://eslint.org/blog/2024/04/eslint-config-inspector/) experience.
import eslintConfigPrettier from "eslint-config-prettier/flat";

export default [
  someConfig,
  eslintConfigPrettier,
];
```

Finally, run the CLI helper tool to find problems in the "rules" sections of your config.

## Plugins

eslint-config-prettier not only turns off core rules, but also some from these plugins automatically:

- @babel/eslint-plugin
- @stylistic/eslint-plugin
- @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin
- eslint-plugin-babel
- eslint-plugin-flowtype
- eslint-plugin-react
- eslint-plugin-standard
- eslint-plugin-unicorn
- eslint-plugin-vue

‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note:** You might find guides on the Internet saying you should also extend stuff like "prettier/react". Since version 8.0.0 of eslint-config-prettier, all you need to extend is "prettier"! That includes all plugins.

## eslint.config.js (flat config) plugin caveat

With flat config, you get to decide the plugin name! For example:

```js
import typescriptEslint from "@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin";
import eslintConfigPrettier from "eslint-config-prettier/flat";

export default [
  {
    plugins: {
      // You'd typically use one of the following two:
      // typescriptEslint: typescriptEslint,
      // typescriptEslint,
      // But in this example we give it another name.
      // It might be tempting to use something shorter like "ts":
      ts: typescriptEslint, // üö® Don't do this!
    },
    rules: {
      // With eslintrc, this is _always_ called:
      // @typescript-eslint/indent
      // But in eslint.config.js (flat config), the name chosen above in `plugins` is used.
      "ts/indent": "error", // üö® Don't do this!
    },
  },
  eslintConfigPrettier,
];
```

You might expect eslint-config-prettier to turn off `ts/indent`, but it won't! Because eslint-config-prettier only turns off `@typescript-eslint/indent`. It cannot know what you chose to call the plugin. Same thing for the CLI helper tool.

Simply stick to the official plugin names and you'll be all good.

If you encounter a shared config that uses a non-standard plugin name, please ask them to use the standard name instead.

## Excluding deprecated rules

Some of the rules that eslint-config-prettier turns off may be deprecated, or even removed from ESLint. This is perfectly fine, but if you really need to omit the deprecated and removed rules, you can do so by setting the `ESLINT_CONFIG_PRETTIER_NO_DEPRECATED` environment variable to a non-empty value. For example:

```bash
env ESLINT_CONFIG_PRETTIER_NO_DEPRECATED=true npx eslint-find-rules --deprecated index.js
```

## CLI helper tool

eslint-config-prettier also ships with a little CLI tool to help you check if your configuration contains any rules that are unnecessary or conflict with Prettier. Here's how to run it:

```bash
npx eslint-config-prettier path/to/main.js
```

(Change `path/to/main.js` to a file that exists in your project.)

## What and why

Now, let's have a look at what it does and why you might want to use it.

üö® This eslintrc example has a conflicting rule "indent" enabled:

```json
{
  "extends": [
    "some-other-config-you-use",
    "prettier"
  ],
  "rules": {
    "indent": "error"
  }
}
```

For eslintrc, while the "prettier" config can disable problematic rules in "some-other-config-you-use", it cannot touch "rules"! (That's how ESLint works ‚Äì it lets you override configs you extend.) The CLI helper tool reports that "indent" conflicts with Prettier, so you can remove it. (Which is nice ‚Äì simplifying your config!)

üö® This eslint.config.js (flat config) example also has a conflicting rule "indent" enabled:

```js
import someConfig from "some-other-config-you-use";
import eslintConfigPrettier from "eslint-config-prettier/flat";

export default [
  someConfig,
  eslintConfigPrettier,
  {
    rules: {
      indent: "error",
    },
  },
];
```

With the new ESLint "flat config" format, you can control what things override what yourself. One way of solving the above conflict is to reorder the config objects so that eslint-config-prettier is last:

```js
import someConfig from "some-other-config-you-use";
import eslintConfigPrettier from "eslint-config-prettier/flat";

export default [
  someConfig,
  {
    rules: {
      indent: "error",
    },
  },
  eslintConfigPrettier, // eslint-config-prettier last
];
```

However, looking at the above config might feel confusing. It looks like we enable the `indent` rule, but in reality it's disabled thanks to the `eslintConfigPrettier` line below it. Instead you might want to actually have your own rules after eslint-config-prettier and run the CLI helper tool to find out about problems, so you can remove conflicting rules from the config file altogether (simplifying your config).

### Checking multiple files

In theory you need to run the tool for every single file in your project to be 100% sure that there are no conflicting rules, because ESLint supports having different rules for different files. Usually you'll have about the same rules for all files, so it is good enough to run the command on one file. But if you use multiple configuration files or overrides, you can provide several files to check:

```bash
npx eslint-config-prettier index.js test/index.js legacy/main.js
```

### Exit codes

- **0**: No problems found.
- **1**: Unexpected error.
- **2**: Conflicting rules found.

### ESLINT_USE_FLAT_CONFIG environment variable

Just like ESLint itself, you can control the eslint-config-prettier CLI helper tool using the `ESLINT_USE_FLAT_CONFIG` environment variable:

- `ESLINT_USE_FLAT_CONFIG=true`: Only use eslint.config.js (flat config).
- `ESLINT_USE_FLAT_CONFIG=false`: Only use eslintrc files.
- Unset or any other value: First try eslint.config.js, then eslintrc.

### Warning

For eslint.config.js (flat config), the CLI helper tool imports `eslint/use-at-your-own-risk` which may break at any time.

### Legacy

eslint-config-prettier versions before 7.0.0 had a slightly different CLI tool that was run in a different way. For example:

```bash
npx eslint --print-config index.js | npx eslint-config-prettier-check
```

If you find something like that in a tutorial, this is what the command looks like in 7.0.0 or later:

```bash
npx eslint-config-prettier index.js
```

## Special rules

There a few rules that eslint-config-prettier disables that actually can be enabled in some cases.

- Some require certain options. The CLI helper tool validates this.
- Some require special attention when writing code. The CLI helper tool warns you if any of those rules are enabled, but can't tell if anything is problematic.
- Some can cause problems if using eslint-plugin-prettier and --fix.

For maximum ease of use, the special rules are disabled by default (provided that you include all needed things in "extends"). If you want them, you need to explicitly specify them in your ESLint config.

### arrow-body-style and prefer-arrow-callback

These rules might cause problems if using eslint-plugin-prettier and `--fix`.

See the [arrow-body-style and prefer-arrow-callback issue](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier/issues/65) for details.

There are a couple of ways to turn these rules off:

- Put "plugin:prettier/recommended" in your "extends". That's eslint-plugin-prettier's recommended config.
- Put "prettier/prettier" in your "extends". (Yes, there's both a rule called "prettier/prettier" and a config called "prettier/prettier".)
- Remove them from your config or turn them off manually.

It doesn't matter which approach you use. "plugin:prettier/recommended" is probably the easiest.

Note: The CLI tool only reports these as problematic if the "prettier/prettier" rule is enabled for the same file.

These rules are safe to use if you don't use eslint-plugin-prettier. In other words, if you run `eslint --fix` and `prettier --write` as separate steps.

### curly

This rule requires certain options.

If a block (for example after if, else, for or while) contains only one statement, JavaScript allows omitting the curly braces around that statement. This rule enforces if or when those optional curly braces should be omitted.

If you use the "multi-line" or "multi-or-nest" option, the rule can conflict with Prettier.

For example, the "multi-line" option allows this line:

```js
if (cart.items && cart.items[0] && cart.items[0].quantity === 0) updateCart(cart);
```

However, Prettier might consider the line too long and turn it into the following, which the "multi-line" option does not allow:

```js
if (cart.items && cart.items[0] && cart.items[0].quantity === 0)
  updateCart(cart);
```

If you like this rule, it can be used just fine with Prettier as long as you don't use the "multi-line" or "multi-or-nest" option.

Example ESLint configuration:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "curly": ["error", "all"]
  }
}
```

### lines-around-comment (deprecated)

(The following applies to @stylistic/lines-around-comment, @stylistic/js/lines-around-comment, @stylistic/ts/lines-around-comment, and @typescript-eslint/lines-around-comment as well.)

This rule can be used with certain options.

This rule requires empty lines before and/or after comments. Prettier preserves blank lines, with two exceptions:

- Several blank lines in a row are collapsed into a single blank line. This is fine.
- Blank lines at the beginning and end of blocks, objects and arrays are always removed. This may lead to conflicts.

By default, ESLint requires a blank line above the comment is this case:

```js
if (result) {

  /* comment */
  return result;
}
```

However, Prettier removes the blank line:

```js
if (result) {
  /* comment */
  return result;
}
```

If you like this rule, it can be used just fine with Prettier as long as you add some extra configuration to allow comments at the start and end of blocks, objects and arrays.

Example ESLint configuration:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "lines-around-comment": [
      "error",
      {
        "beforeBlockComment": true,
        "afterBlockComment": true,
        "beforeLineComment": true,
        "afterLineComment": true,
        "allowBlockStart": true,
        "allowBlockEnd": true,
        "allowObjectStart": true,
        "allowObjectEnd": true,
        "allowArrayStart": true,
        "allowArrayEnd": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### max-len (deprecated)

(The following applies to @stylistic/max-len, @stylistic/js/max-len, and vue/max-len as well.)

This rule requires special attention when writing code.

Usually, Prettier takes care of following a maximum line length automatically. However, there are cases where Prettier can't do anything, such as for long strings, regular expressions and comments. Those need to be split up by a human.

If you'd like to enforce an even stricter maximum line length policy than Prettier can provide automatically, you can enable this rule. Just remember to keep max-len's options and Prettier's printWidth option in sync.

Keep in mind that you might have to refactor code slightly if Prettier formats lines in a way that the max-len rule does not approve of.

Example ESLint configuration:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "max-len": ["error", {"code": 80, "ignoreUrls": true}]
  }
}
```

### no-confusing-arrow (deprecated)

(The following applies to @stylistic/no-confusing-arrow and @stylistic/js/no-confusing-arrow as well.)

This rule requires certain options.

For example, the rule could warn about this line:

```js
var x = a => 1 ? 2 : 3;
```

With `{allowParens: true}` (the default since ESLint 6.0.0), adding parentheses is considered a valid way to avoid the arrow confusion:

```js
var x = a => (1 ? 2 : 3);
```

While Prettier keeps those parentheses, it removes them if the line is long enough to introduce a line break:

```js
EnterpriseCalculator.prototype.calculateImportantNumbers = inputNumber =>
  1 ? 2 : 3;
```

With `{allowParens: false}`, ESLint instead suggests switching to an explicit return:

```js
var x = a => { return 1 ? 2 : 3; };
```

That causes no problems with Prettier.

If you like this rule, it can be used just fine with Prettier as long as the allowParens option is off.

Example ESLint configuration:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "no-confusing-arrow": ["error", { "allowParens": false }]
  }
}
```

(Note: The CLI helper tool considers `{allowParens: true}` to be the default, which is the case since ESLint 6.0.0. The tool will produce a warning if you use the default even if you use an older version of ESLint. It doesn't hurt to explicitly set `{allowParens: false}` even though it is technically redundant. This way you are prepared for a future ESLint upgrade and the CLI tool can be kept simple.)

### no-mixed-operators (deprecated)

(The following applies to @stylistic/no-mixed-operators and @stylistic/js/no-mixed-operators as well.)

This rule requires special attention when writing code.

This rule forbids mixing certain operators, such as && and ||.

For example, the rule could warn about this line:

```js
var foo = a + b * c;
```

The rule suggests adding parentheses, like this:

```js
var foo = a + (b * c);
```

However, Prettier removes many "unnecessary" parentheses, turning it back to:

```js
var foo = a + b * c;
```

If you want to use this rule with Prettier, you need to split the expression into another variable:

```js
var bar = b * c;
var foo = a + bar;
```

Keep in mind that Prettier prints some "unnecessary" parentheses, though:

```js
var foo = (a && b) || c;
```

Example ESLint configuration:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "no-mixed-operators": "error"
  }
}
```

### no-tabs (deprecated)

(The following applies to @stylistic/no-tabs and @stylistic/js/no-tabs as well.)

This rule requires certain options.

This rule disallows the use of tab characters. By default the rule forbids all tab characters. That can be used just fine with Prettier as long as you don't configure Prettier to indent using tabs.

Luckily, it's possible to configure the rule so that it works regardless of whether Prettier uses spaces or tabs: Set `allowIndentationTabs` to true. This way Prettier takes care of your indentation, while the no-tabs takes care of potential tab characters anywhere else in your code.

Example ESLint configuration:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "no-tabs": ["error", {"allowIndentationTabs": true}]
  }
}
```

### no-unexpected-multiline

This rule requires special attention when writing code.

This rule disallows confusing multiline expressions where a newline looks like it is ending a statement, but is not.

For example, the rule could warn about this:

```js
var hello = "world"
[1, 2, 3].forEach(addNumber)
```

Prettier usually formats this in a way that makes it obvious that a semicolon was missing:

```js
var hello = "world"[(1, 2, 3)].forEach(addNumber);
```

However, there are cases where Prettier breaks things into several lines such that the no-unexpected-multiline conflicts.

```js
const value = text.trim().split("\n")[position].toLowerCase();
```

Prettier breaks it up into several lines, though, causing a conflict:

```js
const value = text
  .trim()
  .split("\n")
  [position].toLowerCase();
```

If you like this rule, it can usually be used with Prettier without problems, but occasionally you might need to either temporarily disable the rule or refactor your code.

```js
const value = text
  .trim()
  .split("\n")
  // eslint-disable-next-line no-unexpected-multiline
  [position].toLowerCase();

// Or:

const lines = text.trim().split("\n");
const value = lines[position].toLowerCase();
```

Note: If you do enable this rule, you have to run ESLint and Prettier as two separate steps (and ESLint first) in order to get any value out of it. Otherwise Prettier might reformat your code in such a way that ESLint never gets a chance to report anything (as seen in the first example).

Example configuration:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "no-unexpected-multiline": "error"
  }
}
```

### quotes (deprecated)

(The following applies to babel/quotes, @stylistic/quotes, @stylistic/js/quotes, @stylistic/ts/quotes, and @typescript-eslint/quotes as well.)

This rule requires certain options and certain Prettier options.

Usually, you don't need this rule at all. But there are two cases where it could be useful:

- To enforce the use of backticks rather than single or double quotes for strings.
- To forbid backticks where regular strings could have been used.

#### Enforce backticks

If you'd like all strings to use backticks (never quotes), enable the "backtick" option.

Example ESLint configuration:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "quotes": ["error", "backtick"]
  }
}
```

#### Forbid unnecessary backticks

In the following example, the first array item could have been written with quotes instead of backticks.

```js
const strings = [
  `could have been a regular string`,
  `
    multiple
    lines
  `,
  `uses ${interpolation}`,
  String.raw`\tagged/`,
];
```

If you'd like ESLint to enforce `could have been a regular string` being written as either "could have been a regular string" or 'could have been a regular string', you need to use some specific configuration. The quotes rule has two options, a string option and an object option.

- The first (string) option needs to be set to "single" or "double" and be kept in sync with Prettier's singleQuote option.
- The second (object) option needs the following properties:
  - "avoidEscape": true to follow Prettier's string formatting rules.
  - "allowTemplateLiterals": false to disallow unnecessary backticks.

##### Example double quote configuration

ESLint:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "quotes": [
      "error",
      "double",
      { "avoidEscape": true, "allowTemplateLiterals": false }
    ]
  }
}
```

Prettier (this is the default, so adding this is not required):

```json
{
  "singleQuote": false
}
```

##### Example single quote configuration

ESLint:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "quotes": [
      "error",
      "single",
      { "avoidEscape": true, "allowTemplateLiterals": false }
    ]
  }
}
```

Prettier:

```json
{
  "singleQuote": true
}
```

### unicorn/template-indent

This rule can be used with certain options.

This rule will automatically fix the indentation of multiline string templates, to keep them in alignment with the code they are found in. A configurable whitelist is used to ensure no whitespace-sensitive strings are edited.

Prettier deals with:

- HTML
- CSS
- GraphQL
- markdown

Using various tags, functions and comments.

unicorn/template-indent by default formats some of the same tagged templates, which can cause conflicts. For example, the rule and Prettier disagree about indentation in ternaries:

```js
condition
  ? null
  : html`
      <p>
        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nullam in dui
        mauris.
      </p>
    `;
```

If you like this rule, it can be used just fine with Prettier as long as you configure the rule to not deal with the same templates as Prettier.

Example ESLint configuration:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "unicorn/template-indent": [
      "error",
      {
        "tags": [
          "outdent",
          "dedent",
          "sql",
          "styled"
        ],
        "functions": [
          "dedent",
          "stripIndent"
        ],
        "selectors": [],
        "comments": [
          "indent"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Note: If you use "selectors", the CLI helper tool cannot detect if your selectors might cause conflicts.

### vue/html-self-closing

This rule requires certain options.

This rule enforces whether elements should be self-closing or not.

Prettier generally preserves the way you wrote your elements:

```html
<div />
<div></div>
<MyComponent />
<MyComponent></MyComponent>
<svg><path d="" /></svg>
<svg><path d=""></path></svg>
```

But for known void HTML elements, Prettier always uses the self-closing style. For example, `<img>` is turned into `<img />`.

If you like this rule, it can be used just fine with Prettier as long as you set `html.void` to "any".

Example ESLint configuration:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "vue/html-self-closing": [
      "error",
      {
        "html": {
          "void": "any"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Other rules worth mentioning

These rules don't conflict with Prettier, but have some gotchas when used with Prettier.

### no-sequences

This rule forbids using JavaScript's confusing comma operator (sequence expressions). This piece of code is not doing what it looks like:

```js
matrix[4, 7];
```

Prettier adds parentheses to the above to make it clear that a sequence expression is used:

```js
matrix[(4, 7)];
```

However, the no-sequences rule allows comma operators if the expression sequence is explicitly wrapped in parentheses. Since Prettier automatically wraps them in parentheses, you might never see any warnings from ESLint about comma operators.

Ending up with an accidental sequence expression can easily happen while refactoring. If you want ESLint to catch such mistakes, it is recommended to forbid sequence expressions entirely using `no-restricted-syntax` (as mentioned in the `no-sequences` documentation):

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "no-restricted-syntax": ["error", "SequenceExpression"]
  }
}
```

If you still need to use the comma operator for some edge case, you can place an `// eslint-disable-next-line no-restricted-syntax` comment on the line above the expression. `no-sequences` can safely be disabled if you use the no-restricted-syntax approach.

You can also supply a custom message if you want:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "no-restricted-syntax": [
      "error",
      {
        "selector": "SequenceExpression",
        "message": "The comma operator is confusing and a common mistake. Don't use it!"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Contributing

See `package.json` for the exact versions of ESLint, Prettier and ESLint plugins that eslint-config-prettier has been tested with.

Have new rules been added since those versions? Have we missed any rules? Is there a plugin you would like to see exclusions for? Open an issue or a pull request!

If you'd like to add support for eslint-plugin-foobar, this is how you'd go about it:

First, add rules to index.js:

```js
"foobar/some-rule": "off"
```

Then, create test-lint/foobar.js:

```js
/* eslint-disable quotes */
"use strict";

// Prettier does not want spaces before the parentheses, but
// `plugin:foobar/recommended` wants one.
console.log();
```

test-lint/foobar.js must fail when used with eslint-plugin-foobar and eslint-plugin-prettier at the same time ‚Äì until eslint-config-prettier is added to the ESLint config. The file should be formatted according to Prettier, and that formatting should disagree with the plugin.

Finally, you need to mention the plugin in several places:

- Add eslint-plugin-foobar to the "devDependencies" field in package.json.
- Make sure that at least one rule from eslint-plugin-foobar gets used in .eslintrc.base.js and eslint.base.config.js.
- Add it to the lists of supported plugins in this README.md.

When you're done, run `npm test` to verify that you got it all right. It runs several other npm scripts:

- "test:prettier" checks that Prettier has been run on all files.
- "test:eslint" makes sure that the files in test-lint/ pass ESLint when the exclusions from eslint-config-prettier are used. It also lints the code of eslint-config-prettier itself.
- "test:lint-verify-fail" is run by a test in test/lint-verify-fail.test.js.
- "test:lint-rules" is run by a test in test/rules.test.js.
- "test:jest" runs unit tests that check a number of things:
  - That eslint-plugin-foobar is mentioned in all the places shown above.
  - That no unknown rules are turned off. This helps catching typos, for example.
  - That the CLI works.
- "test:cli-sanity" and "test:cli-sanity-warning" are sanity checks for the CLI.
