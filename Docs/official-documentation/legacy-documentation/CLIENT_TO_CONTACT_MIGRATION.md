# Client â†’ Contact Migration Tracker

This file tracks every reference to "client(s)" in the codebase, categorized by context. Check off each reference as it is converted or removed. Use this as the single source of truth for migration progress.

Legend:
- [ ] = Not yet converted
- [x] = Completed
- **A** = Already has a parallel "contact(s)" implementation (duplicated)
- **B** = Needs to be converted/renamed to "contact(s)"

**Instructions:**
- When you convert a reference, change `[ ]` to `[x]`.
- If you find a reference is already handled by a parallel "contact(s)" implementation, mark as **A**.
- If you convert a reference, update the snippet if needed.
- Add new entries as you discover more references.
