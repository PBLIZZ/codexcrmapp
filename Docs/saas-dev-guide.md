## Critical Success Tips

**Documentation Best Practices:**
- Keep all documents in version control alongside code
- Assign document owners and establish review cycles
- Use collaborative tools for team input and feedback
- Create templates for consistency across projects
- Regular updates with each major feature release

**Team Collaboration:**
- Weekly documentation review meetings
- Cross-functional input on user flows and requirements
- Developer feedback on API and technical specifications
- Stakeholder sign-off on business requirements
- Regular audits of document accuracy and usefulness
