# Task ID: 374
# Title: Search and Remove Remaining Supabase References
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 373
# Priority: medium
# Description: Perform a final search for any remaining Supabase references in the apps/web directory
# Details:
1. Search for all occurrences of 'supabase' in `apps/web` directory (case-insensitive)
2. Search for all occurrences of 'createServerSupabaseClient' in `apps/web` directory
3. Search for all occurrences of '.from(' in `apps/web` directory (this catches database queries)
4. Create a list of any remaining references
5. Do not modify any code, only document findings
6. Exclude package.json and lock files from the search

# Test Strategy:
1. Complete list of remaining Supabase references
2. Verification that no active database queries remain
3. Confirmation that only expected references (like package.json) exist
