- [x] Can access protected routes

Result: ✅ PASS / ⬜ FAIL

### 2. Session Persistence

- [x] Refresh page (F5)
- [x] Still logged in
- [x] Close browser completely
- [x] Reopen and navigate to app

### 3. Logout Flow

Result: ✅ PASS / ⬜ FAIL

### 4. Error Handling

- [x] Try invalid credentials (if using email/password)
- [x] Error message displayed
- [x] Cancel OAuth flow
- [x] Returned to login page

Result: ✅ PASS / ⬜ FAIL

**Note:** The following errors during testing are expected and confirm proper error handling:

- Google One Tap prompt abort: `OneTapComponent.tsx:131 Google One Tap prompt was skipped by the user. Reason: tap_outside`
- OAuth cancellation: `client:74 [GSI_LOGGER]: FedCM get() rejects with AbortError: signal is aborted without reason`
- Invalid login attempt: `POST https://ppzaajcutzyluffvbnrg.supabase.co/auth/v1/token?grant_type=password 400 (Bad Request)`

## Cookie Analysis

```
Supabase cookies found:
- [x] sb-ppzaajcutzyluffvbnrg-auth-token.0 (access token)
- [x] sb-ppzaajcutzyluffvbnrg-auth-token.1 (refresh token)
Cookie attributes:
- [ ] HttpOnly (not present - security enhancement needed)
- [ ] Secure (not needed for localhost)
- [x] SameSite=Lax (correctly configured)
```

## Current Auth Code Locations

- Login page: apps/web/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx
- Auth utilities: apps/web/lib/supabase/[client|server].ts
- Middleware: apps/web/middleware.ts
- Protected layout: apps/web/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx

## Screenshots

- [x] Login page screenshot saved: `/apps/web/public/images/auth/login-page.png`
