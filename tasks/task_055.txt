# Task ID: 55
# Title: Epic A: Multi-Channel Lead Ingestion & Onboarding
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 35, 54, 57
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement comprehensive lead ingestion from multiple sources (webhooks, email, direct integrations, website tracking, WordPress) and a smooth, AI-assisted onboarding experience. Incorporates original task 17 and new features.
# Details:
This epic covers the development of a flexible lead ingestion system that can accept leads from various channels and sources. The system will need to normalize data from different sources and provide a consistent onboarding experience regardless of lead origin. The AI-assisted onboarding will help guide new users through the setup process based on their specific needs and business type.

# Test Strategy:
Testing will include unit tests for each ingestion channel, integration tests for the full lead flow, and end-to-end tests for the onboarding experience. We'll need to simulate leads coming from each supported channel and verify proper handling. For the AI onboarding, we'll need to test various user scenarios and ensure the AI provides appropriate guidance.
