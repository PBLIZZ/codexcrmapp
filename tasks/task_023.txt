# Details:


# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up API documentation for tRPC procedures [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement comprehensive API documentation for all tRPC procedures to facilitate integration and usage by developers.
### Details:
Create documentation templates for tRPC endpoints, document request/response formats, error handling, authentication requirements, and rate limits. Include examples for common use cases and integrate with existing code to auto-generate documentation where possible.

## 2. Implement JSDoc for code documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add JSDoc comments throughout the codebase to document functions, classes, and modules.
### Details:
Define JSDoc standards for the project, create templates for different code elements, document all public APIs, important internal functions, type definitions, and complex logic. Set up a process to generate HTML documentation from JSDoc comments.

## 3. Create user guides and FAQs [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop comprehensive user-facing documentation including guides, tutorials, and frequently asked questions.
### Details:
Identify key user workflows, create step-by-step guides with screenshots, develop troubleshooting guides, compile FAQs from support tickets and user feedback, and organize content for different user roles and experience levels.

## 4. Develop developer documentation with architecture diagrams [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1, 23.2
### Description: Create technical documentation for developers including system architecture, component interactions, and development workflows.
### Details:
Document system architecture with diagrams (using tools like Mermaid or PlantUML), create component relationship diagrams, document data flow, deployment processes, environment setup instructions, and contribution guidelines.

## 5. Set up documentation website or wiki [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1, 23.2, 23.3, 23.4
### Description: Implement a centralized platform to host all documentation with proper organization, search functionality, and version control.
### Details:
Evaluate documentation platforms (e.g., Docusaurus, GitBook, or wiki software), set up the chosen platform, organize content with intuitive navigation, implement search functionality, establish version control for documentation, and create a process for regular updates and maintenance.
