# Task ID: 177
# Title: Add Import Entry Points to UI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 171
# Priority: low
# Description: Add CSV import entry points (buttons/links) to the Settings page, Dashboard, and Contacts sidebar as specified in the PRD.
# Details:
Implement UI entry points for the CSV import feature in three locations:

1. **Settings Page**:
   - Add a dedicated "Import & Export" section
   - Include "Import Contacts" button with CSV icon
   - Add brief description text explaining the feature

2. **Dashboard**:
   - Add a quick action card or button in the "Quick Actions" section
   - Use consistent CSV/import iconography
   - Keep text concise: "Import Contacts"

3. **Contacts Sidebar**:
   - Add "Import" button/link near the top of the sidebar
   - Consider using a smaller button or icon+text combination to fit the sidebar
   - Ensure it's visually distinct but not overwhelming

All entry points should trigger the same import workflow. Ensure consistent styling and behavior across all locations. Add appropriate tooltips explaining the feature. Consider adding a "New" badge if this is a recently released feature.

# Test Strategy:
Verify all three entry points are correctly implemented and styled according to the application's design system. Test that each entry point correctly launches the import workflow. Check responsive behavior on different screen sizes. Verify accessibility of all added UI elements.
