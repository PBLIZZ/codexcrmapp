# Task ID: 168
# Title: Implement CSV File Upload Component
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a reusable file upload component that allows users to select or drag-and-drop a CSV file for contact import.
# Details:
Develop a React component for file upload with the following features:
- Drag-and-drop zone with visual feedback
- File browser button for traditional selection
- File type validation (only accept .csv files)
- Basic file size validation (reject files over 10MB)
- Visual feedback for valid/invalid files
- Progress indicator during upload

The component should emit events for:
- File selected/validated
- Upload progress
- Upload complete
- Upload error

Use modern React patterns with hooks and consider using a library like react-dropzone for the core functionality. Style according to the application's design system.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test the component with various file types to ensure proper validation. Test drag-and-drop and button selection methods. Mock file uploads to test progress and completion states. Verify all expected events are emitted correctly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement core drag-and-drop functionality [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the base CSV file upload component with drag-and-drop capabilities
### Details:
Use react-dropzone or similar library to implement the core drag-and-drop functionality. Create a component that allows users to either drag files onto a designated area or click to open a file browser. Handle the basic file selection events and set up the component's initial state management. Include visual feedback for when files are being dragged over the drop zone.

## 2. Implement file validation and error handling [done]
### Dependencies: 168.1
### Description: Add validation for CSV files and proper error handling mechanisms
### Details:
Add validation to ensure only CSV files are accepted. Implement checks for file type, size limits, and basic content validation. Create error states and messages for different validation failures (wrong file type, file too large, malformed CSV, etc.). Provide clear user feedback when validation fails and handle edge cases gracefully.

## 3. Create upload progress visualization [done]
### Dependencies: 168.1, 168.2
### Description: Implement visual indicators for file upload progress
### Details:
Add a progress bar or other visual indicator that shows the upload status. Implement the necessary state management to track upload progress percentage. Create different visual states for various stages of the upload process (preparing, uploading, processing, complete, error). Ensure the UI provides clear feedback throughout the entire upload lifecycle.

## 4. Implement event emission and parent component integration [done]
### Dependencies: 168.1, 168.2, 168.3
### Description: Set up proper event handling and communication with parent components
### Details:
Create a clean API for the component that emits appropriate events (onUploadStart, onProgress, onComplete, onError, etc.). Implement proper props for configuration options. Document the component's API for other developers. Create example integration code showing how parent components can consume and interact with the upload component.
