# Title: Navbar logout still produces TRPCClientError: UNAUTHORIZED
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high

Logout from the /account page works correctly. Investigate the cause of the error, which might be related to component re-renders triggering protected tRPC calls during the logout transition.
