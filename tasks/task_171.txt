Implement as a modal flow or dedicated page with clear navigation. Use progress indicators to show current step. Ensure responsive design works on all device sizes.

# Test Strategy:
Create comprehensive UI tests for each screen in the workflow. Test navigation between steps, validation of inputs, and proper state management. Verify responsive design on different screen sizes. Test accessibility compliance. Conduct user testing to ensure the flow is intuitive.
