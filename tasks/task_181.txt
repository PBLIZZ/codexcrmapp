# Task ID: 181
# Title: Create End-to-End Testing Suite for CSV Import
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 171, 172, 174, 175, 178, 179, 180
# Priority: low
# Description: Develop comprehensive end-to-end tests covering the entire CSV import workflow from file upload to database verification.
# Details:
Create an end-to-end testing suite using Cypress or a similar framework that tests:

1. **Complete import workflows**:
   - Happy path: Valid CSV with new contacts only
   - Duplicate handling: Testing both skip and overwrite options
   - Error handling: CSV with various validation errors
   - Edge cases: Empty CSV, maximum size CSV, etc.

2. **UI interactions**:
   - File upload functionality
   - Step navigation (next, back, cancel)
   - Error message display
   - Progress indication
   - Result summary display

3. **Data verification**:
   - Confirm new contacts appear in the database
   - Verify contact fields match CSV data
   - Check duplicate handling works as selected
   - Verify error reporting for invalid rows

4. **Performance aspects**:
   - Test with various file sizes
   - Verify UI responsiveness during import
   - Check progress tracking accuracy

Create test fixtures with various CSV files representing different scenarios. Implement proper test cleanup to reset the database state between tests. Document all test scenarios and expected outcomes.

# Test Strategy:
Run the end-to-end test suite in CI/CD pipeline. Verify all test scenarios pass consistently. Monitor test execution times and optimize if necessary. Ensure tests are resilient to minor UI changes. Review test coverage to identify any gaps in testing.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Test Fixtures and Data Preparation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop reusable test fixtures and sample data for end-to-end testing of the import workflow
### Details:
Create mock CSV/Excel files with various data patterns, set up database snapshots for consistent test starting points, implement helper functions for test data generation, and establish environment configuration for isolated testing. Include both valid and invalid data samples for comprehensive testing.

## 2. Implement Happy Path Workflow Tests [pending]
### Dependencies: 181.1
### Description: Develop tests that verify the complete successful execution of the import workflow
### Details:
Create tests that simulate user uploading valid files, mapping columns correctly, confirming import, and completing the process. Verify each step of the UI workflow functions as expected, test different valid file formats, and confirm success notifications appear appropriately. Include assertions for expected database state after successful imports.

## 3. Implement Error Handling and Edge Case Tests [pending]
### Dependencies: 181.1, 181.2
### Description: Create tests for error conditions, boundary cases, and exception handling throughout the import workflow
### Details:
Test scenarios including invalid file formats, malformed data, extremely large files, duplicate records, missing required fields, and unexpected user interactions (cancellations, refreshes, etc.). Verify appropriate error messages are displayed and the system maintains data integrity during failure scenarios.

## 4. Implement Database Verification and Cleanup Procedures [pending]
### Dependencies: 181.1, 181.2, 181.3
### Description: Create robust verification and cleanup mechanisms for the test database
### Details:
Develop assertions to verify database state after tests, implement transaction rollbacks or database resets between tests, create cleanup routines to remove test data, and establish isolation between test runs. Include verification of data integrity constraints and expected relationships between imported entities.
