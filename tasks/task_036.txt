# Title: Epic C: AI Action Approval & Scheduling System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 35
# Priority: high
# Description: Implementing a system for users to review, approve, and manage AI-generated actions, supported by a background job scheduling system.
# Details:
This epic builds upon Epic B (AI Action Generation) to create a comprehensive workflow for human review, approval, and scheduling of AI-generated actions. The system will provide interfaces for users to evaluate suggested actions, approve or reject them with feedback, and schedule approved actions for execution at appropriate times. This ensures human oversight in the AI decision-making process while enabling efficient action management.
