# Task ID: 174
# Title: Implement Error Reporting and Download
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 169, 172
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create functionality to generate detailed error reports for failed imports and allow users to download these reports as CSV files.
# Details:
Develop a system that:

1. Collects detailed error information during import:
   - Row number in original CSV
   - All field values from the problematic row
   - Specific error message(s) for each field
   - Error type/category

2. Creates a downloadable CSV error report with columns:
   - row_number
   - error_message
   - error_type
   - All original CSV columns with the row's data

3. Implements a frontend component to:
   - Display a summary of errors (count by type)
   - Provide a download button for the full error report
   - Show a preview of the first few errors directly in the UI

4. Handles various error types:
   - Validation errors (invalid email format, etc.)
   - Missing required fields
   - Data type/format errors
   - Database constraint violations

Ensure the error messages are user-friendly and actionable, explaining what went wrong and how to fix it. The download functionality should work across all modern browsers.

# Test Strategy:
Test error collection with various types of import failures. Verify the CSV generation produces valid, downloadable files. Test the UI components for error display and download functionality. Verify error messages are clear and helpful. Test with different browsers to ensure download compatibility.

# Subtasks:
