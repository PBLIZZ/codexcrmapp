# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Universal Webhook Receiver Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a technical design document for the universal webhook receiver that can accept and process webhooks from various sources
### Details:
Include endpoint design, authentication mechanisms, payload validation, and error handling. Consider scalability requirements and how to handle different webhook formats from various services. Document the API contract and data flow.

## 2. Implement Core Webhook Receiver Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 73.1
### Description: Develop the core webhook receiver service that can accept HTTP requests from external systems
### Details:
Create the HTTP endpoint that accepts POST requests, validates request signatures/authentication, logs incoming payloads, and acknowledges receipt. Implement request throttling, IP filtering if needed, and basic security measures. Ensure proper error handling and response codes.

## 3. Develop Webhook Processing Pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 73.2
### Description: Create a flexible processing pipeline that can route and transform webhook data for different internal systems
### Details:
Implement a plugin-based architecture for webhook processors that can handle different webhook formats. Create a configuration system to map incoming webhooks to appropriate processors. Develop queuing mechanism for asynchronous processing and implement retry logic for failed webhook processing. Add monitoring and alerting for webhook processing failures.
