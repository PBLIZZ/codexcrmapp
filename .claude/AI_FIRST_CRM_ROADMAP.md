# AI-First CRM Development Roadmap

## Current Status & Completed Work

### ✅ Completed Major Milestones
1. **Contact Form Architecture Redesign** - Transformed from unified form to specialized components
2. **AI-First ViewContactForm** - Implemented Day.ai-inspired relationship intelligence interface
3. **Folder Structure Cleanup** - Proper Next.js App Router organization
4. **CSV Import Removal** - Replaced with modern AI-first data connection approach
5. **Linting & Code Quality** - All ESLint errors resolved
6. **Website URL Auto-fixing** - Smart validation and user-friendly error handling

### ✅ Current Form Components Status
- **NewContactForm.tsx** - ✅ Enhanced with LLM enhancement placeholder, validation, toast notifications
- **EditContactForm.tsx** - ✅ Comprehensive validation, change tracking, collapsible sections, toast notifications  
- **ViewContactForm.tsx** - ✅ Completely redesigned with AI insights, interaction timeline, social media integration
- **ContactsSidebar.tsx** - ✅ Updated to "Connect Data" instead of CSV import

### ✅ Route Structure (Properly Organized)
```
/contacts/ → contacts list
/contacts/new/ → create new contact ✅
/contacts/[contactId]/ → view contact details  
/contacts/[contactId]/edit/ → edit contact
/contacts/connect/ → AI-first data connections ✅
```

## 🚨 Critical Remaining Tasks

### 1. **Refactor Data Model for Relationship Intelligence** (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Current Issue**: Database schema doesn't support AI-first relationship data

**Required Changes**:
```typescript
// NEW INTERFACES ALREADY DEFINED IN ViewContactForm.tsx:
interface ContactInteraction {
  id: string;
  type: 'email' | 'meeting' | 'social' | 'note' | 'call' | 'session';
  date: Date;
  title: string;
  summary?: string;
  sentiment?: 'positive' | 'neutral' | 'negative';
  outcome?: string;
  duration?: number;
  platform?: string;
}

interface AIInsight {
  id: string;
  type: 'summary' | 'career' | 'interests' | 'goals' | 'next_steps';
  content: string;
  confidence: number;
  lastUpdated: Date;
}
```

**Action Items**:
- Update Prisma schema to add `ContactInteraction` and `AIInsight` tables
- Add relationships between Contact → ContactInteraction (one-to-many)
- Add relationships between Contact → AIInsight (one-to-many)
- Run database migration
- Update Contact model to include these relationships

### 2. **Update tRPC Schema for New Data Types** (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Current Issue**: API doesn't support interaction/insight data

**Required Changes**:
```typescript
// In /lib/trpc/routers/contact.ts
- Add procedures for ContactInteraction CRUD
- Add procedures for AIInsight CRUD  
- Update contact queries to include interactions and insights
- Add bulk operations for interactions
```

**Action Items**:
- Extend `contactInputSchema` to support interactions/insights
- Add new tRPC procedures:
  - `contacts.addInteraction`
  - `contacts.getInteractions` 
  - `contacts.updateInsight`
  - `contacts.generateInsights` (AI placeholder)

### 3. **Align Forms with AI-First Philosophy** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Current Issue**: NewContactForm and EditContactForm still use traditional field-based approach

**NewContactForm Improvements Needed**:
- Implement actual LLM enhancement (currently placeholder)
- Add voice input capability
- Smart field auto-completion from partial data
- AI-powered group classification

**EditContactForm Improvements Needed**:
- Add AI insights section
- Implement interaction timeline editing
- Smart field suggestions based on AI analysis

## 🎯 Guiding Principles for Continued Development

### 1. **AI-First Design Philosophy**
- **Prioritize intelligence over data entry** - Forms should assist and enhance rather than just collect
- **Relationship-focused, not field-focused** - Think about connections and context, not just contact details
- **Progressive disclosure** - Show what's relevant when it's relevant
- **Conversation-driven UX** - Move toward chat-like interactions over form-filling

### 2. **Technical Architecture Principles**
- **Component separation by purpose** - Keep New/View/Edit specialized for their use cases
- **AI integration points** - Every form should have clear hooks for AI enhancement
- **Type safety** - Use TypeScript interfaces for all AI data structures
- **Graceful degradation** - Forms work without AI, enhanced with AI

### 3. **Data Connection Strategy** 
- **No CSV imports** - Focus on live data connections (email, calendar, social)
- **Enrichment over entry** - Auto-populate from available sources
- **Context preservation** - Maintain relationship context, not just flat contact data
- **Real-time intelligence** - Insights should update as new interactions occur

### 4. **User Experience Guidelines**
- **Minimal friction for essential tasks** - Quick contact creation, easy editing
- **Rich context for relationship management** - Detailed view with AI insights
- **Smart defaults and suggestions** - Use AI to predict user needs
- **Transparent AI assistance** - Show when AI is helping, allow user control

## 🚀 Next Session Priorities

### Immediate (High Impact, Low Effort)
1. **Database Migration** - Add ContactInteraction and AIInsight tables
2. **tRPC Extensions** - Add API endpoints for new data types
3. **ViewContactForm Integration** - Connect AI insights to real data (currently mock)

### Short-term (This Week)
1. **NewContactForm AI Enhancement** - Implement actual LLM integration for contact enrichment
2. **EditContactForm AI Features** - Add insights panel and interaction timeline
3. **Connect Data Sources** - Implement at least one real integration (email/calendar)

### Medium-term (Next Sprint)
1. **Voice Input Integration** - Add speech-to-text for contact creation
2. **Smart Field Completion** - AI-powered auto-complete and suggestions
3. **Relationship Intelligence** - Implement connection mapping between contacts

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Code Quality Maintained
- All linting errors resolved ✅
- TypeScript strict mode compliance ✅
- Component separation clean ✅
- Error handling comprehensive ✅

### Key Dependencies
- Current tRPC router: `/lib/trpc/routers/contact.ts`
- Database schema: Uses Prisma with Supabase
- UI components: ShadCN UI with Tailwind
- AI integration: Ready for OpenAI/Anthropic APIs

### Breaking Changes Avoided
- All existing routes still functional ✅
- Backward compatibility maintained ✅
- Database changes will be additive (new tables) ✅

This roadmap should provide clear direction for continuing the AI-first CRM transformation while maintaining the excellent foundation that's been built.
